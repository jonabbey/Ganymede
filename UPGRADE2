                           Ganymede 2.0 Upgrade Guide

   Release 2.0 - April 1, 2008
   $Rev: 7960 $

   This document discusses what's new in Ganymede 2.0, and what you'll need
   to think about if you are upgrading from an installation of Ganymede 1.0.

   By [2]Jonathan Abbey

Welcome to Ganymede 2.0

   While Ganymede 2.0 is more similar to Ganymede 1.0 than it is different,
   the 2.0 series is the product of nearly ten years of development and
   refinement, and essentially every facet of the product has been refined,
   polished to a high shine, or at least tweaked, relative to the Ganymede
   1.0 releases.

   The major functional differences between the Ganymede 1.0 series and
   Ganymede 2.0 are as follows:

     * The entire source code tree has been refactored for clarity, and the
       build system is now based on Ant.
     * Ganymede now requires Java 5 (JDK1.5) or later, and can be built and
       deployed properly with Sun's 5.x, 6.x, or later.
     * All RMI client/server communications are now SSL encrypted, and any
       RMI calls that were previously made from the server to the client have
       been reversed so that clients will work properly on systems with local
       firewalls. In addition, Ganymede no longer requires an external RMI
       registry process.
     * Ganymede 2.0 supports a new [3]incremental XML build system that can
       enqueue directory changes for transmission to external directory
       services that support discrete change commands.
     * Ganymede 2.0 has an [4]SQL-like textual query language which is
       available for programming in the Ganymede framework, as well as for
       doing direct queries with the [5]xmlclient.
     * The Ganymede client, server, and admin console are internationalized,
       and all user-facing message strings have been pulled into
       language-specific resource files to support easy translation. A German
       language translation is included.
     * Scalability and performance is now very significantly improved,
       particularly in XML processing. Overall memory usage of the server has
       been reduced by at least 15%.
     * A number of changes have been made to the Ganymede data model and APIs
       to ensure correct and predictable behavior, including a new
       requirement that all objects have guaranteed unique labels. There were
       some minor changes to the XML schema used for data dumping and
       loading. It is now possible to group object fields in custom tabs to
       reduce clutter in the client.
     * A significant number of fit, polish, and reliability improvements have
       been made to every part of the Ganymede product. The client and admin
       console now use the Java 1.4 Preferences API to remember window
       position and other miscellaneous details. The Ganymede client can now
       receive and transmit Ganymede XML data.
     * The Ganymede server will now generate an 'externalerror' system event
       if an external build returns a non-zero result code. You can take
       advantage of this feature to properly monitor your builds.
     * Ganymede now knows how to generate hash text for passwords in
       OpenLDAP/Netscape's Salted SHA password hash format, as well as Ulrich
       Drepper's [6]Unix Crypt with Sha algorithm.
     * Ganymede is now a U.S. registered trademark of The University of Texas
       at Austin.

   For a comprehensive list of changes in the 2.0 release, please see the
   [7]CHANGES file. You should be especially sure to consult this file if you
   have any previous programming experience with the Ganymede framework, as a
   good number of minor changes have accumulated over the last few years.

Schema Changes

     * A number of fields have been renamed since Ganymede 1.0. These renames
       should be handled automatically for you if you try to load a Ganymede
       1.0 series database file with a Ganymede 2.0 server, but if you are
       doing XML loading, you may need to be aware of the following name
       changes:

       +--------------------------------------------------------------------+
       | Object | Field  | Field Type | Old Field  |     New Field Name     |
       |        | Number |            |    Name    |                        |
       |--------+--------+------------+------------+------------------------|
       | System | 103    | boolean    | Event Mail | Send Mail              |
       | Event  |        |            |            |                        |
       |--------+--------+------------+------------+------------------------|
       | System | 106    | boolean    | Cc Owner   | Cc Owners              |
       | Event  |        |            | Groups     |                        |
       |--------+--------+------------+------------+------------------------|
       | Owner  | 105    | string     | Mail List  | External Mail List     |
       | Group  |        |            |            |                        |
       |--------+--------+------------+------------+------------------------|
       |        |        | permission | Owned      | Objects Owned Access   |
       | Role   | 101    | matrix     | Object     | Bits                   |
       |        |        |            | Bits       |                        |
       |--------+--------+------------+------------+------------------------|
       | Role   | 103    | permission | Default    | Default Access Bits    |
       |        |        | matrix     | Bits       |                        |
       +--------------------------------------------------------------------+

     * If you have a Ganymede 1.x schema that does not force unique labels on
       all object types, Ganymede 2.0 will give you a warning when you go to
       load your old ganymede.db file. If you bring up the Ganymede schema
       editor or use the xmlclient to tweak the schema, no changes will
       accepted to your schema until you resolve the unique label issue.

     * The Objects Owned Invid field in the Owner Group object has been
       removed. This change makes it possible for multiple administrators to
       create objects in a common Owner Group without experiencing lock-out.
       This will again be handled for you automatically if you load a
       Ganymede 1.0 db file, but if you are working with XML, you may need be
       aware of this, particularly when loading Permission Matrix dumps.

     * If you have custom plugin classes written against Ganymede 1.0, you
       will absolutely need to make some changes in order to get your classes
       working properly in Ganymede 2.0.

       The most elementary change is that classes in the Ganymede server have
       been shuffled around to different packages for clarity in the source
       tree and build process. You will need to make sure you use
       arlut.csd.ganymede.common for classes that are used on the server and
       on the client, arlut.csd.ganymede.rmi for RMI interfaces, and
       arlut.csd.ganymede.server for the classes that uniquely comprise the
       Ganymede server.

       A wide variety of methods in several classes in the Ganymede server
       now throw an arlut.csd.ganymede.common.GanyPermissionException when
       permission problems are encountered. This is a checked exception, so
       you may need to modify your code to handle this exception
       intelligently.

       The DBEditObject 'deleting' boolean has been made private. You'll need
       to use the DBEditObject.isDeleting() method to test the deleting
       status of an editable object.

       Otherwise, I believe the classes you'll use in writing your own plugin
       subclasses for DBEditObject and GanymedeBuilder shouldn't need a great
       deal of changes. Most of the other method changes have been done in a
       backwards compatible fashion.

       If you're writing a new set of plugin classes, you may find that there
       are some more convenient methods to use when writing your custom logic
       than were available in the 1.x time frame. For instance, many methods
       that deal with fields allow you to look up or address fields by their
       display name, rather than having to use numeric codes. Be aware that
       if you use the name-based methods, you will make it difficult for
       yourself if you want to produce a version of your schema kit in other
       languages, however.
     * Vector fields can no longer hold duplicates. This was implicit in some
       of the code before, it is now explicit. If you attempt to load an old
       ganymede.db file that includes duplicate values in a Vector field, the
       system will allow the duplication, and this can surprise some code.

       So, beware. When in doubt, use xmlclient in your Ganymede 1.x
       installation to dump your data to disk, examine for duplicates, and
       reload into your 2.x installation using the xmlclient.
