--====================================================================--

1) What is Ganymede?

   Ganymede is a system for managing network directories.  A network
directory is something like NIS, LDAP, or DNS.  Ganymede has its own
built-in object database that holds authoritative information and
which is fed into NIS, DNS, etc., when things change.  Unlike stock
NIS, DNS, or LDAP, Ganymede is designed to be very smart about what
changes are allowed to the network information.

   Customizers can write Java classes to provide very sophisticated
data checking and inter-object relationship maintenance.  The Ganymede
server does a lot to keep everything sane.. if you delete a user, the
user is automatically removed from all groups, email lists, systems,
etc., that refer to the user.  If any of those secondary changes would
violate permissions, the whole operation is refused.

   With Ganymede's sophisticated permissions system, you can give
different levels of authority to different kinds of users, over
distinct portions of Ganymede's database, making it possible for
administrators to take care of their own portions of your network
directories without getting in each others' way.  Ganymede logs all
changes and has an extensive system for sending email notification to
various interested parties when things change. Objects in the database
can be set to expire or be removed at a later date, making it possible
to create temporary user accounts and so forth.

   Customizers/adopters can write code to take the data from Ganymede
and propagate it into NIS, DNS, or anything else when changes are made
in the Ganymede database.  At ARL:UT, we take the data from Ganymede and
propagate it into NIS, DNS, tacacs+ for router configuration, Samba,
Active Directory, Sendmail, OpenLDAP, and more.

   In addition to maintaining the directory services, Ganymede also
triggers external scripts to create users' home directories, handle
user rename, NFS volume creation, etc. Having a central point
through which all network information changes go through before
fanning out to all of your network distribution mechanisms is
extremely powerful.

   Ganymede is much more than a simple directory system like LDAP,
NIS, or even DNS. Ganymede is a total system for managing your
directory information, and is designed with the goal of making it
possible to let even untrained clerical staff handle things like user
and DNS record creation and maintenance.

     ------------------------------------------------------------

2) Great!  Then I can just jump right in and use it, right?

   Um, no.  Ganymede itself is an extensible and customizable system
that can do a tremendous amount for you, but right now it is not an
'out-of-the-box' admin package.  In order to make Ganymede useful, you
need a schema kit, which consists of a database definition for the
network information you want to manage, a set of custom Java plug-in
classes that will make the Ganymede server smart about how your
information is supposed to be connected together, and a set of classes
and scripts that will take information from Ganymede and propagate it
into your network.

   Ganymede comes with a few demonstration schema kits, and one very
complex schema kit that manages the ARL:UT laboratory environment, but if
you are serious about Ganymede you're going to need to do some work to
design your network environment management system.

   Hopefully as time goes on, people will produce a variety of schema
kits that will be useful for a variety of common scenarios (like
managing DNS at an ISP, for instance), but whenever you get into an
environment as complex as Ganymede is designed to be able to handle,
you're likely to get a lot of details that will be different for each
network.

     ------------------------------------------------------------

3) Who should be thinking of using Ganymede?

   From reading the above, you can tell that Ganymede is probably
overkill for a small network.  If you start getting hundreds of users
and/or hundreds of systems, Ganymede will make your life a lot better,
but for less than a couple dozen systems or users, you may find that
Ganymede is a bit much.  Ganymede is not at all a good fit for
managing things on a single system.. the Ganymede server takes up a
lot of memory and you just wouldn't need its features for something so
small.

     ------------------------------------------------------------

4) Is Ganymede secure from packet-sniffing?

  Yes.  The Ganymede 2.0 server opens two TCP ports for communication
with the Ganymede client and admin console.  Communications to the first
port (the RMI registry) is unencrypted, but the only traffic to that port
is the server telling the clients where to find the second port.

  The second port is what the clients use to log in and talk to the
server.  Communications to and from this port are protected with
SSL.  The Ganymede client and server are cryptographically mated.
The server contains a private key that is generated when you build
the software, along with a matching public key certificate.  This
certificate is incorporated into the client so that the client can
validate the server's identity.

  In addition to protecting the data communications with SSL, the
server is configured to cryptographically randomize the RMI-level
object identifiers, to prevent attackers from attempting to inject
commands to objects on the Ganymede server that are published for
someone else's client.

     ------------------------------------------------------------

5) What do I need to run Ganymede?

   The Ganymede distribution is packaged as a gzipped UNIX tar file,
and requires GNU tar to decompress it, due to extremely long
file/path names in the archive.

   The Ganymede system requires Java 5 or better.  Since Ganymede
supports running the Ganymede client and admin console on Windows
browsers with Sun's Plug-In (see
http://java.sun.com/products/plugin/), you can get away with just the
basic Java environment on your UNIX system to run the server on.

   The Ganymede server can be memory intensive, as all data registered in
Ganymede is kept in an in-memory database backed by disk.  A 64 meg
system dedicated to Ganymede is adequate to run a lab like ours, with
DNS for a couple thousand systems, and user, group, and email records
for around 1000 users.  More memory is better.  You'll probably want a
Pentium 200 or better for good performance on something like Linux.
JITs are great, anything with a good generational garbage collector
like Sun's HotSpot VM are super-great.

   (The above paragraph is pretty old, obviously, but it's still true,
   so I'm perfectly happy leaving it as it is. ;-)

   The best way to launch the Ganymede clients is to use Sun's Java
Web Start product, which comes with Sun's Java environment.  Mac OS
X ships with very good Java Web Start support, as well.

     ------------------------------------------------------------

6) How scalable is Ganymede, with its memory-based database?

   Fairly scalable.  At ARL:UT, we use Ganymede to manage a rather
complex NIS domain containing around 800 users and our DNS domain with
over 2500 system records defined. During execution our Ganymede server
takes up only about 9 megabytes of JVM heap space.

   During development of Ganymede 2.0, we test-loaded the Ganymede
server to 250,000 users and 250,000 groups of random data, using the
userKit.  At those crazy levels, the Ganymede server balloons up to
600 megs of RAM, but it still works fine.

   So we feel very confident in saying that the Ganymede server should be
able to scale up to handle just about as large a set of data as you'd ever
want to manage on a single server.

   The server should degrade gracefully if the heap usage gets to be
too much.  As the amount of data loaded into the server increases
towards the upper limits that can be held in the the JVM's maximum
allocated heap, garbage collection activity will increase
significantly.  If there is simply too much data to fit into the set
heap size, an OutOfMemoryError will eventually be thrown and the
server will be unable to handle new logins, new object creation, and
such.  With the current design an OutOfMemoryError would not cause
precipitous data loss.  At the worst, the server would have to be shut
down, the amount of heap dedicated to the jvm increased, and the
server re-started.  If the heap size is bumping up against the maximum
available on a given machine, it would be necessary to export the
server's data to XML, split the data, and create separate Ganymede
servers for separate subdomains or separate object types.

   The final word on scalability remains that you should be sure and
test with a representative dataset before committing to Ganymede, and
if you find that it doesn't scale adequately, report your findings to
the Ganymede mailing list.

     ------------------------------------------------------------

7) Why isn't Ganymede LDAP-based?  What about replication?

   For a number of reasons, most having to do with the fact that
development on Ganymede started in early 1996, before LDAP was as
prominent as it is today.  Ganymede provides a lot of intelligence and
customizability that you don't get with a stock LDAP solution, and its
transaction and permissions models are superior to that of LDAP.

   The point of Ganymede is as much intelligent management of changes
and relationships as it is mass storage of data.  Because Ganymede has
a richer data model in some ways (object id's, symmetrical object
pointers, explicit representations of IP address data types), and
poorer in others (Ganymede's current lack of support for an object
type hierarchy), reworking Ganymede on-top of LDAP would be difficult.
A lot of the intelligent management of Ganymede would have to be
sacrificed in such a move, although the resulting system would
probably be more scalable and would have higher performance at the
high end.

   Going to a multi-server Ganymede system, a la Active Directory and
NDS and LDAP servers generally might be interesting, but that would be
Hard.  All of the namespace indices used for unique-value management
and object locking would have to be coordinated across servers, and in
such a way that a server could go down and be brought back up without
losing such run-time state.  Also, the scripts to emit data from
Ganymede server's into local DNS, NIS, and the like would be complex.

   Generally speaking, Ganymede is not intended to be the service that
operating system (PAM) and/or application code consults directly.
Instead, Ganymede is intended to feed things like NIS, DNS, and LDAP,
which have their own means of doing replication and redundant servers
for backups.

   In Ganymede 2.0, we have a new Synchronization system based on
XML deltas which we use at the laboratory to manage Active Directory and
OpenLDAP servers.  The external code we use to do this is Deepak Giridharagopal's
excellent but cryptically named 'SyncUtils' package for Python.

     ------------------------------------------------------------

8) What's up with DNS management?  The current stuff is weak.

   Yes, that's true.  Our use of Ganymede to manage DNS is limited to
only that which we need in our environment, and it's part of the
larger GASHARL schema kit, which is partially shipped with Ganymede
2.0.  If you want a more full featured DNS management kit built on top
of Ganymede, and you can speak German, take a look at DoctorDNS, at
http://www.doctordns.org/.

     ------------------------------------------------------------

9) Where's the documentation?

   What documentation do you want?  I know more and better docs are
needed, but feedback is pretty scarce.  Are the current docs adequate
at all?  Where does it break?  Ask questions, send mail to the
Ganymede mailing list (ganymede@arlut.utexas.edu).  Code development
is like a child's brain, it needs input.

   If you haven't seen it, look on the Ganymede web page
(http://www.arlut.utexas.edu/gash2/) for the 1998 LISA paper we wrote
on Ganymede.  It provides a very good conceptual and technical
overview.  It's not so good as an operational manual, but we're
struggling to get more operational documentation written.

     ------------------------------------------------------------

10) How can I help?

   Send in bug reports and success reports, to
jonabbey@arlut.utexas.edu or, preferably, ganymede@arlut.utexas.edu to
send it to the mailing list.  If you are having problems or see an
issue, it's likely people on the list will be interested and have
something to say about it as well.

   Help is always welcome. Ganymede is designed to be a generic engine
that can be customized with schema kits for differing
environments.. if you want to work to customize Ganymede for some
environment, let the list know.  If you see things in the basic engine
or client that you think you could contribute to improving, let me
know.

     ------------------------------------------------------------

11) Why is it called Ganymede?

   It's actually an acronym, standing for GAsh Network Manager, Deluxe
Edition.  I wanted a name that connected this project to GASH, and I
just couldn't come up with any great names that involved GASH in some
fashion (I did come up with a lot of really bad names, though...)

     ------------------------------------------------------------

12) What is Ganymede's development history like?

   Ganymede is the successor to GASH, the Group Admin Shell, which was
developed at ARL:UT starting in early 1993, and which was presented at
the USENIX LISA VIII conference in San Diego, CA in September, 1994.
Refinements and further development of GASH continued into mid-1995,
before we decided that the GASH design wouldn't carry us much further
without massive pain and effort.

   Initial work on spec'ing Ganymede started in late 1995.  After
several months of planning on pen and paper, active code development
started around June 1996.  In March 1998, the first binary developer's
pre-release was put on the ftp site.  In December 1998, we presented
Ganymede at the USENIX LISA XII conference in Boston, MA.  The first
full source distribution, under GPL licensing, was sent out in
January, 1999.

  Minor refinements continued for several years as ARL:UT used Ganymede in
24/7 production.

  Work on Ganymede 2.0 began in earnest in 2004 when the release of
Subversion made it feasible to really move things around and start
breaking things in the source tree.  Since then, we've made continual
refinements and improvements, some quite extensive.

  We've recently moved to GIT, and that has accelerated our work even
further.

  At this point, Ganymede proper has been under development for twelve
years, and in 24/7 production use for nine.

     ------------------------------------------------------------

13) When I try to start the Ganymede server, I see a message complaining about
    the system hostname resolving to the 127.0.0.1 loopback address and
    the server quits.  What's going on?

The Ganymede server is trying to protect you from a misconfiguration
of your system.

In order for the Ganymede server to work, it needs to create a URL for
its internal RMI registry describing the network name that the
Ganymede server wants to be known by.  This will look like
rmi://myhost.domain.com:1099/ganymede.server.  When the Ganymede
server's internal rmiregistry receives a network call asking to talk
to the Ganymede server's RMI entry point, it will return an IP address
and TCP port number that the client should use to talk to the server.

On some systems, the 'hostname' command returns a name that is
associated with the 127.0.0.1 loopback address in /etc/hosts.  On such
systems, the RMI registry will get the idea that the I.P. address that
the client should talk to in order to find the server is 127.0.0.1.
127.0.0.1 is a 'magic' address, which is always interpreted to mean
'myself'.  Remote Ganymede clients obviously won't find the server on
their own system, so you'll experience mysterious failures when the
clients try to talk to the server.

To prevent this problem, the Ganymede server checks the system's idea
of its name against the 127.0.0.1 address.  If it finds that the
systems' hostname would cause the RMI registry to provide the unhelpful
127.0.0.1 address, it tries instead to use the system name provided by
the user when the Ganymede server was installed.  If that name also
resolves to 127.0.0.1, the server prints the error message and exits,
rather than confusing you with an inability to talk to remote clients.

If you experience this problem, edit the server's ganymede.properties
file and change the ganymede.serverhost definition to something that
will resolve on the server to something other than 127.0.0.1.  This
can even be the server's network accessible I.P. address, if you like.

Hopefully a future version of the Java RMI registry classes will have
smarter behavior regarding the loopback address.  If you do find that
you need to override this check, you can edit the server's runServer
script and add the -forcelocalhost option to the Java invocation line.

     ------------------------------------------------------------

14) Where's the Ganymede web site?

    http://www.arlut.utexas.edu/gash2/

     ------------------------------------------------------------

15) What's the best way to report bugs?  How should I ask questions?

    We have a bugzilla database running at the Ganymede web site.  You should
visit the bugzilla database and report bugs there.  

    If you want a more interactive experience, or if you want to email
questions, you should send email to the Ganymede Discussion mailing
list at ganymede@arlut.utexas.edu, and your mail will be seen by
a decently large number of people with an interest in Ganymede.
Sending mail to ganymede@arlut.utexas.edu also results in an online
web archive of your questions, so that others will later be able to
see the question you asked or bug you reported.

    Thanks!
