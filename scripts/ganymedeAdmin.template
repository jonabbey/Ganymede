# DEBUG controls whether the JVM that runs the Ganymede admin console
# will allow a Java debugger to attach to it.  If you want to allow a
# Java debugger to attach to the admin console, set 'DEBUG=-Xdebug'.
# If you want to allow a debugger to attach to the admin console and
# you want to force the JVM to run in interpreted mode for some
# reason, set 'DEBUG=-Xdebug -Xint'.

DEBUG=

# MINHEAP controls the heap size that the JVM running the Ganymede
# admin console will initially allocate on startup, and which will be
# kept as a minimum heap size during execution. It should be expressed
# as a number followed by the letter 'm' for megabyte.  I.e.,
# 'MINHEAP=32m', or 'MINHEAP=64m'.

MINHEAP=32m

# MAXHEAP controls the maximum size the Ganymede admin console's heap
# can grow to.  It should be expressed as a number followed by the
# letter 'm' for megabyte.  I.e., 'MAXHEAP=256m', or 'MAXHEAP=2048m'.

MAXHEAP=64m

# RMISECURITY has a property that prevents the client from trying to
# download classes from the server.

RMISECURITY=-Djava.rmi.server.useCodebaseOnly=true

# If you want to force the use of a specific language in the client,
# without respect to the native locale of the Java installation, you
# can modify this variable to specify a specific language, such as
#
# German:
# LANGUAGE=-Duser.language=de
#
# English:
# LANGUAGE=-Duser.language=en
#
# Leaving LANGUAGE blank will result in the default language for the
# Java installation being used, which is probably what you usually
# want.
