This is a sample ASCII version of a motd for the server.  It is stored in
<server install directory>/db/text/motd.txt.  It can and should be
modified by your Ganymede administrator.  This text file can be edited at
any time.  If it has changed since the last time a Ganymede user has logged
in, the primary GUI client will display this file, assuming an html version
of this file is not available.
