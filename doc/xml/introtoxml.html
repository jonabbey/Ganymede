      Like HTML, XML is a plain text data format with structural
      tagging.  Unlike HTML, which has a predefined set of tags that
      represent the structuring and rendering facilities of modern web
      browsers, XML has no pre-defined document tags.  Instead, XML
      allows applications to define their own sets of tags for use
      according to the XML syntactical rules.  Using XML can be very
      simple or very complex, depending on how many of the fancy features
      you try to use.  Ganymede uses fairly simple XML, and this page
      is intended to present the most basic facts about XML that you will
      need to know to write syntactically valid XML files that Ganymede
      can handle.
    </p>

    <p>
      Facts about XML:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><p>Tags are case-sensitive.  &lt;tag&gt;, &lt;Tag&gt; and &lt;TAG&gt;
	  are all separate tags, and will not be treated as equivalent by an XML parser.</p></li>
      <li><p>All tags must come in pairs.  HTML browsers can tolerate tags that stand alone,
	  like &lt;br&gt; and &lt;p&gt;, but XML is more strict, and all elements must
	  have an open tag (&lt;element&gt;) and a close tag (&lt;/element&gt;).</p></li>
      
      <li><p>The structure of
	  XML files must be strictly tree-like.  That is, XML structural elements can contain
	  other XML structural elements, but one XML structural element may not be partially
	  contained by another.</p>
	
	<p>In other words,</p>

	<pre>
        &lt;element1&gt;
          &lt;element2&gt;
        &lt;/element1&gt;
      &lt;/element2&gt;
	</pre>
	
	<p>is an invalid XML sequence, as the element2 and element1 structural elements are intermingled.</p>
	
	<p>In contrast,</p>
	
	<pre>
        &lt;element1&gt;
          &lt;element2&gt;&lt;/element2&gt;
        &lt;/element1&gt;
	</pre>
	
	<p>is perfectly valid, because the entirety of element2 is contained
	  within element1.</p>
      </li>
      
      <li><p>In cases like the above, where the element2 element's open and close tag are 
	  immediately adjacent, XML supports a special syntax for an empty element.  The
	  same legal XML structure shown above could be written as:</p>
	<pre>
        &lt;element1&gt;
          &lt;element2/&gt;
        &lt;/element1&gt;
	</pre>
	
	<p>where the trailing slash in the element2 element indicates that there will be no
	  matching close tag to come along.  At any other time an element open tag (&lt;element&gt;) is seen,
	  a compliant XML parser will expect and demand to see the matching close tag (&lt;/element&gt;)
	  for that element before it sees the close tag for any elements higher up in the
	  document structure.</p>
      </li>
      <li><p>In XML, all XML documents contain a single element (the <b>Document Element</b>, in
	  XML lingo) which contains in turn any other
	  elements and character data.  The start tag for the document element will generally
	  be the first thing in an XML file's content proper, and the matching close tag
	  for the document element will be the last thing in the XML file.  For this reason, the
	  following XML fragment could not be an entire XML file:</p>
	<pre>
          &lt;element1&gt;
            &lt;element2/&gt;
          &lt;/element1&gt;
          &lt;element3&gt;
            &lt;element4&gt;
              &lt;element5/&gt;
            &lt;/element4&gt;
          &lt;/element3&gt;
        </pre>
	<p>Because element1 does not contain elements 3, 4, and 5.</p>
      </li>

      <li><p>In XML, all attribute data must be quoted, as in</p>
	<pre>
          &lt;object label="labeldata"&gt;
        </pre>
	<p>The following is illegal:</p>
	<pre>
          &lt;object label=labeldata&gt;
        </pre>
      </li>

      <li><p>
	  All possible characters are legal within the double
	  quotes surrounding an attribute's value except the
	  <b>'&amp;'</b> character and the double quotation mark itself.
	  If you need to include a double quotation mark in an attribute's
	  data field, you have to use <b>&amp;quot;</b></p> <p>For
	  example, if you wanted the string <b>'He said "hi" &amp; I waved back.'</b> in an XML
	  tag attribute, you would have to do it this way:</p>
	<pre>
          &lt;sentence text="He said &amp;quot;hi&amp;quot; &amp;amp; I waved back."/&gt;
        </pre>
	
	<p>
	  Newlines and other whitespace are explicitly acceptable
	  within the quoted value of an attribute.
	</p>
      </li>

      <li><p>
	  Likewise, if you want to include the <b>'&lt;'</b>,
	  <b>'&gt;'</b>, or <b>'&amp;'</b> characters anywhere in the body of
	  an XML document, for anything other than tag or special character
	  definitions, you need to use <b>'&amp;lt;'</b>,
	  <b>'&amp;gt;'</b>, and <b>'&amp;amp;'</b> instead, just as with HTML.</p>
      </li>

      <li><p>XML files use <a
	    href="http://www.unicode.org/">Unicode</a>,
	  with the <b>UTF-8</b> encoding, typically.  American 7-bit ASCII
	  is a proper subset of Unicode and require no special
	  handling in <b>UTF-8</b> encoding.  International characters 
	  may be used in XML files, but you must do so in a manner
	  compliant with <b>UTF-8</b>.  Ganymede will always emit XML files
	  using the standard UNIX end-of-line character, but as with any
	  XML parser, Ganymede can also handle DOS/Windows style line
	  termination when reading XML files.</p>
      </li>
	  
      <li><p>There are limitations on what characters you can
	  use for tag and attribute names.  The rules on this are
	  somewhat complex, but for the purpose of XML use with
	  Ganymede at present, only the following characters will ever be
	  used:</p>

	<pre>
           abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789.-_
	</pre>

	<p>Eventually, Ganymede may be elaborated so that it knows all 
	  of the rules for XML character limitations in the full
	  Unicode character range, but for now, only the above
	  characters will ever appear or be used in XML tag and
	  attribute names for use with Ganymede.</p>
      </li>
      <li><p>Unlike in HTML, the XML standard does not specify that whitespace
	  can be ignored or contracted.  For Ganymede's purposes, however,
	  whitespace between tags is generally ignored, and newlines and
	  indentation are nice for human readability but not necessary for
	  Ganymede's input parsing.  More on this as we discuss what Ganymede
	  does with XML, below.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>That's about all you should need to know about XML, at least as
    far as we'll need to talk about in discussing Ganymede.  If you
    want to read about things like external reference entities,
    Document Type Definitions/DTD's, or the precise Backus-Naur style
    specification for what characters are allowed to go where when,
    you can probably find your way to the original XML standards
    documents over at <a
