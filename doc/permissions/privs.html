    <h1>Ganymede Privileges, Ownership, and Admin Personae</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>One of the lessons learned from the development and use of GASH
    was that it is important to have as flexible a permissions system
    as possible.  GASH's permissions model was highly <i>ad hoc</i>, and
    differed for each kind of object managed by GASH.  The Ganymede
    Server uses a much more detailed and flexible permissions model.</p>

    <p>You can read a detailed discussion of the Ganymede permissions model
    <a href="permDesign.html">here</a>.  This document will illustrate
    the prinicples through screen shots of the client in action.</p>

    <tr>
    <td>All objects in the server are owned by owner groups.  Each owner group
        has a name, a set of admin personae as members, and a set of objects that
	it (nonexclusively) owns.</td>

    <td>The members of owner groups are known as admin personae.  Each admin persona is
        associated with a Ganymede user account, with the exception of the special
        supergash and monitor admin personae.<p>
        An admin persona is a member of 0 or more owner groups, and is said to own
        all objects owned by those owner groups (and by owner groups owned by those
        owner groups and so on, recursively).</td>
    <td><img align=left src="admin-persona.gif"></td>

      <tr BGCOLOR="#CCFFCC">
	<td colspan="2"><h2><b>Roles</b></h2></td>
      </tr>
    <tr>
	<td>


	  <p>An admin persona's access to fields is controlled by the
	  permission sets in the Role the admin persona is associated
	  with.  Each admin persona can be associated with one or more
	  Roles, which collectively grant permission to access certain
	  object types and certain fields of those objects.</p>

	  <p> Each Role contains two permission arrays.  One array
	  determines the permissions that an admin persona has on
	  objects owned by that admin (through the owner groups), and
	  one determines what access an admin has to objects not
	  specifically owned by that admin.  This can be used to give
	  an admin the ability to view certain pieces of information
	  about any user, group, system, etc., in the Ganymede
	  server.</p>

	  <p>Finally, there is a default Role, with its own permission
	  sets, which controls what minimum privileges all users have,
	  and specifically what permission end users have.</p>

	  <p> All users registered in Ganymede have the nominal right
	  to log in to the server, and will generally be able to do
	  things like change their phone number, password, and so on.
