    <p>
      Starting with the <font color="#008800">1.0</font> series,
      the Ganymede server gains the ability to import and export data
      using <a href="http://www.xml.com/">XML</a>.  Like HTML, XML is
      a plain text data format with structural tagging.  Unlike HTML,
      which has a predefined set of tags that represent the
      structuring and rendering facilities of modern web browsers, XML
      has no pre-defined document tags.  Instead, XML allows
      applications to define their own sets of tags for use according
      to the XML syntactical rules.  Ganymede uses XML to structure
      its data structures in a way that is accessible to other
      software and even readable by humans. Before we get into
      discussing the custom tags used by Ganymede, it is worth setting
      forth a number of facts about XML in general that software needs
      to know about in order to properly communicate with Ganymede via
      XML.

    <p>
      Facts about XML:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><p>Tags are case-sensitive.  &lt;tag&gt;, &lt;Tag&gt; and &lt;TAG&gt;
	  are all separate tags, and will not be treated as equivalent by an XML parser.</p></li>
      <li><p>All tags must come in pairs.  HTML browsers can tolerate tags that stand alone,
	  like &lt;br&gt; and &lt;p&gt;, but XML is more strict, and all elements must
	  have an open tag (&lt;element&gt;) and a close tag (&lt;/element&gt;).</p></li>
      
      <li><p>The structure of
	  XML files must be strictly tree-like.  That is, XML structural elements can contain
	  other XML structural elements, but one XML structural element may not be partially
	  contained by another.</p>
	
	<p>In other words,</p>

	<pre>
        &lt;element1&gt;
          &lt;element2&gt;
        &lt;/element1&gt;
      &lt;/element2&gt;
	</pre>
	
	<p>is an invalid XML sequence, as the element2 and element1 structural elements are intermingled.</p>
	
	<p>In contrast,</p>
	
	<pre>
        &lt;element1&gt;
          &lt;element2&gt;&lt;/element2&gt;
        &lt;/element1&gt;
	</pre>
	
	<p>is perfectly valid, because the entirety of element2 is contained
	  within element1.</p>
      </li>
      
      <li><p>In cases like the above, where the element2 element's open and close tag are 
	  immediately adjacent, XML supports a special syntax for an <b>Empty Element</b>, that
	  is, an element which does not contain any thing between the open tag and close tag.  The
	  same legal XML structure shown above could be written as:</p>
	<pre>
        &lt;element1&gt;
          &lt;element2/&gt;
        &lt;/element1&gt;
	</pre>
	
	<p>where the trailing slash in the element2 element indicates that there will be no
	  matching close tag to come along.  At any other time an element open tag (&lt;element&gt;) is seen,
	  a compliant XML parser will expect and demand to see the matching close tag (&lt;/element&gt;)
	  for that element before it sees the close tag for any elements higher up in the
	  document structure.</p>
      </li>
      <li><p>In XML, all XML documents contain a single element (the <b>Document Element</b>, in
	  XML lingo) which contains in turn any other
	  elements and character data.  The start tag for the document element will generally
	  be the first thing in an XML file's content proper, and the matching close tag
	  for the document element will be the last thing in the XML file.  For this reason, the
	  following XML fragment could not be an entire XML file:</p>
	<pre>
          &lt;element1&gt;
            &lt;element2/&gt;
          &lt;/element1&gt;
          &lt;element3&gt;
            &lt;element4&gt;
              &lt;element5/&gt;
            &lt;/element4&gt;
          &lt;/element3&gt;
        </pre>
	<p>Because element1 does not contain elements 3, 4, and 5.</p>
      </li>

      <li><p>In XML, all attribute data must be quoted, as in</p>
	<pre>
          &lt;object label="labeldata"&gt;
        </pre>
	<p>The following is illegal:</p>
	<pre>
          &lt;object label=labeldata&gt;
        </pre>
      </li>

      <li><p>
	  All possible characters are legal within the double
	  quotes surrounding an attribute's value except the
	  <b>'&amp;'</b> character and the double quotation mark itself.
	  If you need to include a double quotation mark in an attribute's
	  data field, you have to use <b>&amp;quot;</b></p> <p>For
	  example, if you wanted the string <b>'He said "hi" &amp; I waved back.'</b> in an XML
	  tag attribute, you would have to do it this way:</p>
	<pre>
          &lt;sentence text="He said &amp;quot;hi&amp;quot; &amp;amp; I waved back."/&gt;
        </pre>
	
	<p>
	  Newlines and other whitespace are explicitly acceptable
	  within the quoted value of an attribute.
	</p>
      </li>

      <li><p>
	  Likewise, if you want to include the <b>'&lt;'</b>,
	  <b>'&gt;'</b>, or <b>'&amp;'</b> characters anywhere in the body of
	  an XML document, for anything other than tag or special character
	  definitions, you need to use <b>'&amp;lt;'</b>,
	  <b>'&amp;gt;'</b>, and <b>'&amp;amp;'</b> instead, just as with HTML.</p>
      </li>

      <li><p>XML files use <a
	    href="http://www.unicode.org/">Unicode</a>,
	  with the <b>UTF-8</b> encoding, typically.  American 7-bit ASCII
	  is a proper subset of Unicode and require no special
	  handling in <b>UTF-8</b> encoding.  International characters 
	  may be used in XML files, but you must do so in a manner
	  compliant with <b>UTF-8</b>.  Ganymede will always emit XML files
	  using the standard UNIX end-of-line character, but as with any
	  XML parser, Ganymede can also handle DOS/Windows style line
	  termination when reading XML files.</p>
      </li>
	  
      <li><p>There are limitations on what characters you can
	  use for tag and attribute names.  The rules on this are
	  somewhat complex, but for the purpose of XML use with
	  Ganymede at present, only the following characters will ever be
	  used:</p>

	<pre>
           abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789.-_
	</pre>

	<p>Eventually, Ganymede may be elaborated so that it knows all 
	  of the rules for XML character limitations in the full
	  Unicode character range, but for now, only the above
	  characters will ever appear or be used in XML tag and
	  attribute names for use with Ganymede.</p>
      </li>
      <li><p>Unlike in HTML, the XML standard does not specify that whitespace
	  can be ignored or contracted.  For Ganymede's purposes, however,
	  whitespace between tags is generally ignored, and newlines and
	  indentation are nice for human readability but not necessary for
	  Ganymede's input parsing.  More on this as we discuss what Ganymede
	  does with XML, below.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>That's about all you should need to know about XML, at least as
    far as we'll need to talk about in discussing Ganymede.  If you
    want to read about things like external reference entities,
    Document Type Definitions/DTD's, or the precise Backus-Naur style
    specification for what characters are allowed to go where when,
    you can probably find your way to the original XML standards
    documents over at <a
    href="http://www.xml.com/">www.XML.com</a>.</p>

    </table> 
    
    <p>Ganymede exports and imports object and schema data using a
    simple XML format, in which the schema definition section and the
    object data sections comprise two separate elements.  The basic
    structure of an XML file for Ganymede looks like this:</p>

    <pre>
      &lt;ganymede major="1" minor="0" persona="supergash" password="testpass"&gt;
        &lt;ganyschema&gt;
           -- Optional Ganymede Schema Definition Section Here --
        &lt;/ganyschema&gt;
        &lt;ganydata&gt;
           -- Optional Ganymede Object Data Section Here --
        &lt;/ganydata&gt;
      &lt;/ganymede&gt;
    </pre>

    <p>The <b>ganymede</b> element is the XML file's <b>Document
    Element</b>, and has two mandatory attributes, <b>major</b> and
    <b>minor</b>, which specify the major and minor version numbers of
    the Ganymede XML file format the file adheres to, and two
      optional attributes, <b>persona</b> and <b>password</b>, which
      may be used to specify the username and password for the xmlclient
      to use in attempting to log into the server to apply the changes
      in the file.</p>

    <p>The <b>ganyschema</b> element contains the schema definition
    for the Ganymede database.  This section contains definitions of
    the types of objects that the Ganymede server knows about,
    including the fields defined for those objects and the constraints
    and relationships among those fields and objects.  The field
    definitions in the Ganymede schema definition section control what
    fields may legally appear in the object data section of a Ganymede
    XML file, and what kind of data those fields are allowed to
    contain.</p>

    <p>The optional <b>ganydata</b> element contains actual data
    records from the Ganymede database.  The <b>ganydata</b> element
    contains a number of <b>object</b> elements, each of which contain
    the data for a single object in the Ganymede database.</p>

    <p>Each of these two sections are optional, but an XML file
      without one of these two sections is pointless, as far as
      Ganymede is concerned.  The sections below discuss these two
      components of a Ganymede XML file in detail.</p>

    <table border="1" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" width="100%">
      <tr BGCOLOR="#CCFFCC">
	<td colspan="1"><h2><b>Ganymede Schema Definition in XML</b></h2></td>
      </tr>
    </table> 

    <p>The <b>&lt;ganyschema&gt;</b> element defines the structure of
      the Ganymede database, what types of objects are defined, what
      fields they have, what kind of data those fields can contained,
      and what everything is called.  As of 1.0pre1 beta 2, there is
      no code written that can read this section and set the server's
      schema accordingly, but if the server is run with the -doXML
      option, the server will dump out a ganymede.db.xml file that
      will include the <b>&lt;ganyschema&gt;</b> section.</p>

    <p>The <b>&lt;ganyschema&gt;</b> element contains in turn two
      other elements, <b>&lt;namespaces&gt;</b> and
      <b>&lt;object_type_definitions&gt;</b>.</p>

    <pre>
    &lt;ganyschema&gt;
      &lt;namespaces&gt;
         -- Optional Namespace Definitions --
      &lt;/namespaces&gt;
      &lt;object_type_definitions&gt;
         -- Object And Field Definitions --
      &lt;/object_type_definitions&gt;
    &lt;/ganyschema&gt;
    </pre>

    <table border="1" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" width="100%">
      <tr BGCOLOR="#CCCCFF">
	<td colspan="1" align="right"><h3><b>&lt;namespaces&gt;</b></h3></td></tr></table>

    <p>The <b>&lt;namespaces&gt;</b> element contains definition
      elements for all unique namespace structures in the server.  A
      namespace is essentially a unique value index that the server
      uses to assure that, across all fields in the database connected 
      to the namespace, no value is repeated.  Namespaces are used to
      keep user, group, and system names unique, among other
      things.</p>

    <p>Here is an example &lt;namespaces&gt; element that would be contained
      at the start of a &lt;ganyschema&gt; element:</p>

    <pre>
    &lt;namespaces&gt;
      &lt;namespace name="username"/&gt;
      &lt;namespace name="groupname"/&gt;
      &lt;namespace name="IPspace"/&gt;
      &lt;namespace name="UserCategory" case-sensitive="true"/&gt;
      &lt;namespace name="systemtype" case-sensitive="true"/&gt;
    &lt;/namespaces&gt;
    </pre>

    <p>In this example, the username, groupname, and IPspace
    namespaces consider two strings to be equivalent for namespace
    conflict considerations even if two instances of the string have
    different capitalization.  The UserCategory and systemtype name
    spaces will not consider two strings to be in conflict if they
    have different capitalizations.</p>

    <p>Namespaces are only significant when they are attached to
    fields in the &lt;object_type_definitions&gt; section, as we will
    see shortly.</p>

    <table border="1" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" width="100%">
      <tr BGCOLOR="#CCCCFF">
	<td colspan="1" align="right"><h3><b>&lt;object_type_definitions&gt;</b></h3></td></tr></table>

    <p>In the Ganymede server, all data stored is stored in the form
    of fields, which are aggregated in objects.  Each object stored in
    the Ganymede server is of a certain type, such as a user, group,
    system, network, or whatever else has been defined in the server's
    schema.  The objects, in turn, may be grouped into categories.
    Categories are a way of grouping similar kinds of objects together
    so that they may be viewed or ignored in the client's tree view.</p>

    <p>The <b>&lt;object_type_definitions&gt;</b> element under the
    <b>&lt;ganyschema&gt;</b> element contains the actual schema
    definition information in terms of categories, objects, and
    fields.  The corresponding elements for these are the
    <b>&lt;category&gt;</b>, <b>&lt;objectdef&gt;</b>, and
    <b>&lt;fielddef&gt;</b> elements.</p>

    <p>Here is an example:</p>

    <pre>
    &lt;object_type_definitions&gt;
      &lt;category name="Categories"&gt;
        &lt;category name="Admin-Level Objects"&gt;
          &lt;category name="Events"&gt;
            &lt;objectdef name="System_Events" id="4"&gt;
              &lt;classdef name="arlut.csd.ganymede.eventCustom"/&gt;
              &lt;label fieldid="100"/&gt;
              &lt;fielddef name="Event_Token" id="100"&gt;
                &lt;comment&gt;Single-word token for this event class&lt;/comment&gt;
                &lt;typedef type="string"&gt;
                  &lt;maxlength val="32"/&gt;
                  &lt;badchars val=" |"/&gt;
                  &lt;namespace val="eventtoken"/&gt;
                &lt;/typedef&gt;
              &lt;/fielddef&gt;
              &lt;fielddef name="Event_Mail" id="103"&gt;
                &lt;comment&gt;If true, events of this type should be mailed&lt;/comment&gt;
                &lt;typedef type="boolean"/&gt;
              &lt;/fielddef&gt;
              &lt;fielddef name="Mail_List" id="107"&gt;
                &lt;typedef type="string"&gt;
                  &lt;vector/&gt;
                &lt;/typedef&gt;
              &lt;/fielddef&gt;
            &lt;/objectdef&gt;
          &lt;/category&gt;
        &lt;/category&gt;
      &lt;/category&gt;
    &lt;/object_type_definitions&gt;
    </pre>

    <p>This example is of a small portion of a Ganymede server's
    schema definition.  This fragment shows an object type called
    'System Events' which is contained in which has three fields
    defined; a scalar string field called 'Event Token' which is
    connected to the 'eventtoken' namespace, a boolean checkbox field
    caleld 'Event Mail', and a vector string field called 'Mail
    List'.</p>

    <p>The 'System Events' object is contained within an 'Events'
    category, which is contained in turn within a 'Admin-Level
    Objects' category.  The 'Categories' category is itself simply a
    container for the other categories.. it is the category root node.
    All &lt;object_type_definitions&gt; elements in Ganymede XML
    schema definition sections should contain a top-level 'Categories'
    category, even if you don't want any categorical organization of
    object types in the client.  Note that all &lt;category&gt; elements
    that are opened are properly closed before the close of the
    &lt;object_type_definitions&gt; element.</p>

    <p><a name="underscore">Whenever the Ganymede server refers to object or field names,
    any spaces in the object or field name is replaced by an
    underscore in the XML file.  This is so that when actual instances
    of objects are recorded in the &lt;ganydata&gt; element, encoded
    field names can be used directly as element names.  Category names
    are never referred to from elsewhere in the XML file, so the
    category names do not have spaces converted to underscores.</p>

    <table border="1" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" width="100%">
      <tr BGCOLOR="#CCCCFF">
	<td colspan="1" align="right"><h3><b>&lt;objectdef&gt;</b></h3></td></tr></table>

    <p>The <b>objectdef</b> element is used to define object types in the
    Ganymede server.  Each object type has a name and a numeric id,
    which are defined in an open objectdef tag via the <b>'name'</b>
    and <b>'id'</b> attributes.  Both of these values must be unique
    within the &lt;ganyschema&gt; section.  The value of the
    <b>'id'</b> attribute must be an integer number, and the value of
    the <b>'name'</b> attribute must be a string which contains only
    the letters a-z, in upper or lower case, numbers, a period, a
    dash, or a space.</p>

    <p>Example:</p>

    <pre>
       &lt;objectdef name="User" id="3"&gt;
    </pre>

    <p>Within the <b>objectdef</b> element, there are a couple of
    optional elements that define optional characteristics of the
    object, followed by a series of <b>fielddef</b> elements.</p>

    <p>The optional elements are the <b>&lt;classdef&gt;</b>,
    <b>&lt;embedded&gt;</b> and <b>&lt;label&gt;</b> elements.</p>

    <p>The <b>classdef</b> element, if present, specifies the fully
    qualified class name of a Java class to be loaded by the server to
    manage server operations on objects of this type.  The
    <b>classdef</b> element has a <b>name</b> attribute whose value is
    the name of the Java class to be used. See <a
    href="customization/index.html">the DBEditObject subclassing
    guide</a> for details on the use of custom classes in the Ganymede
    server. The <b>classdef</b> element must be empty.  That is, it
    must not contain any other elements.</p>

    <p>Example:</p>

    <pre>
       &lt;classdef name="arlut.csd.ganymede.custom.userCustom"/&gt;
    </pre>

    <p>or (equivalently)</p>

    <pre>
       &lt;classdef name="arlut.csd.ganymede.custom.userCustom"&gt;&lt;/classdef&gt;
    </pre>

    <p>The optional <b>embedded</b> element, if present, indicates
    that the object is not a top-level object which will be shown in
    the client's object tree and which will have its ownership and
    permissions tracked independently, but rather is an embedded
    object which will be encapsulated in another object of a defined
    type.  The <b>embedded</b> element must be empty and it takes no
    attributes.</p>

    <p>Example:</p>

    <pre>
       &lt;embedded/&gt;
    </pre>
    
    <p>The optional <b>label</b> element has a <b>fieldid</b>
    attribute which gives the numeric field id of the field within the
    object which is to serve as the label field.  Objects do not need
    to have designated label fields, but if they do, they can have
    only one, and it must refer to a String, IP, Numeric, or Floating
    Point field defined within the &lt;objectdef&gt; element.
    Password, Permission Matrix, Object Reference, and Boolean fields
    may not be specified as label fields.  The <b>label</b> element
    must be empty.</p>

    <p>Example:</p>

    <pre>
       &lt;label fieldid="100"/&gt;
    </pre>

    <p>Once the optional elements are out of the way, we get down to
    the meat of an object definition element.. the fields.  The
    <b>objectdef</b> element will typically contain a series of
    <b>fielddef</b> elements, one for each field defined in this
    object type.  These <b>fielddef</b> elements are listed in
    the order they should appear in the client.  The first <b>fielddef</b>
    element in an <b>objectdef</b> element will appear at the
    top of the object editing window in the Ganymede client, with
    subsequent <b>fielddef</b>'s in order below the first.</p>

    <table border="1" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" width="100%">
      <tr BGCOLOR="#CCCCFF">
	<td colspan="1" align="right"><h3><b>&lt;fielddef&gt;</b></h3></td></tr></table>

    <p>The <b>&lt;fielddef&gt;</b> element is a complex one, with many
    possible component elements.  There are currently 9 different
    kinds of fields supported by the Ganymede server, and each of
    these field types have different options available.  The open tag
    for the <b>fielddef</b> element itself is fairly simple, however.
    It has just two attributes, both mandatory.  These are the same as
    the ones used in the <b>objectdef</b> tag.. <b>name</b> and
    <b>id</b>.  The contents of the <b>name</b> attribute is limited
    in precisely the same manner as the <b>name</b> attribute of the
    <b>objectdef</b> tag's <b>name</b> attribute.  It must contain
    only letters in the standard ASCII set, a-z, the numbers 0-9, a
    period or dash, and an underscore in place of a space.  The
    <b>id</b> attribute must be an integer number less than 32768.</p>

    <p>Example of the <b>fielddef</b> element's open tag:</p>

    <pre>
      &lt;fielddef name="Username" id="100"&gt;
    </pre>

    <p>The <b>fielddef</b> element can contain a couple of optional
    elements, <b>comment</b>, and <b>invisible</b>.</p>

    <p>The <b>comment</b> element is a text containing element.  All
    text between the opening <b>&lt;comment&gt;</b> tag and the
    closing <b>&lt;/comment&gt;</b> tags is treated as a comment to
    attach to the field.  The Ganymede GUI client will show this text
    as a pop-up tooltip if the user lets the mouse linger on the GUI
    component.  Aside from some text, however, the <b>comment</b>
    element should not contain any subelements.</p>

    <p>The <b>invisible</b> element is an optional empty element,
    signifying that the field defined by the containing
    <b>fielddef</b> element should not be visible in the Ganymede
    client.  This is used to establish invisible scratch fields used
    by custom code associated with the containing <b>objectdef</b>
    element for various purposes.  This is a rather unusual element to
    define in a <b>fielddef</b> element, and will only be present in
    special cases.</p>

    <p>Here's a (contrived) example of these two optional elements in use.</p>

    <pre>
      &lt;fielddef name="Hidden_Field" id="302"&gt;
        &lt;comment&gt;This is a hidden field to be used for namespace manipulations.&lt;/comment&gt;
        &lt;invisible/&gt;
      &lt;/fielddef&gt;
    </pre>

    <p>Okay, with the two optional elements out of the way, it's time
    for the meat of the <b>fielddef</b> element, the <b>typedef</b>
    element.  The <b>typedef</b> element specifies what kind of data
    field the containing <b>fielddef</b> field definition element
    defines, and has a single attribute, <b>type</b>.  The <b>type</b>
    attribute can have any of the values listed in the following
    table:</p>

    <table border=1>
      <tr>
	<th>Type</th><th>Explanation</th><th>Vector Allowed?</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
	<td>string</td><td>Unicode String</td><td>YES</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
	<td>ip</td><td>I.P. Address, IPv4 or IPv6</td><td>YES</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
	<td>invid</td><td>Object Reference</td><td>YES</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
	<td>boolean</td><td>Boolean</td><td>NO</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
	<td>date</td><td>Date/Timestamp</td><td>NO</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
	<td>numeric</td><td>Integer Number Field</td><td>NO</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
	<td>float</td><td>Double precision float</td><td>NO</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
	<td>password</td><td>Password Field</td><td>NO</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
	<td>permmatrix</td><td>Ganymede Permissions Matrix</td><td>NO</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <p>For example:</p>

    <pre>
      &lt;typedef type="string"&gt;
    </pre>

    <p>After the <b>typedef</b> element open tag, there can be a
    variety of elements, depending on the element's type.</p>

    <p>First off, the <b>string</b>, <b>ip</b>, and <b>invid</b> field
    types can be <b>vector</b> fields, in which a single data field
    can contain more than one value.  In that case, the <b>typedef</b>
      element will contain a <b>vector</b> element.</p>

    <p>The <b>vector</b> element is an empty element with a single
      attribute, <b>maxSize</b>, which has a numeric value specifying
      the maximum number of values that can be held in this field
      at a time.  For example, </p>

    <pre>
      &lt;typedef type="string"&gt;
        &lt;vector maxSize="100"/&gt;
      &lt;/typedef&gt;
    </pre>

    <p>would describe a vector string field that could contain up to
    100 strings in the field.  Vector fields in Ganymede can not hold
    more than 32767 elements, so if no <b>maxSize</b> attribute is
    defined, an implicit value of 32767 is still in effect.</p>

    <p>After the optional <b>vector</b> element (for the
    <b>string</b>, <b>ip</b>, and <b>invid</b> types only), there are
    a number of optional field constraint elements which differ by
    type.  These are summarized in the table below.  The trickiest
    options conceptually are those associated with the <b>invid</b>
    field type.  I need to link this material to a general discussion
    of invid fields.</p>

<dl>

<p>
<dt><b>type</b></dt>
<dd>The name of the type this object belongs to.  This string
is case sensitive and must match the <b>name</b> attribute for
the type's <b>&lt;objectdef&gt;</b> element, which is the object's
type name with <a href="#underscore">underscores substituted for spaces</a>.</dd>

<dt><b>id</b></dt>

<dd>An optional identifier string for this object, unique among
objects of this type within the <b>&lt;ganydata&gt;</b> element in
this XML file.  If this string is not present, the <b>num</b>
attribute becomes mandatory. The <b>id</b> attribute is used for two
purposes; the first is to identify an object on the server to be
edited, inactivated or deleted if the <b>action</b> attribute
specifies these actions.  This may only be done if objects of this
type on the server have unique and determinable labels.  The second is
to act as a target for <b>&lt;invid&gt;</b> elements within the XML
file to use to refer to <b>&lt;object&gt;</b> elements that are
created during the XML file processing.</dd>

<dt><b>num</b></dt>

<dd>An optional object number for this object, unique among objects of
this type on the server.  If this number is not present, the <b>id</b>
attribute becomes mandatory.  If both the <b>id</b> and <b>num</b>
attributes are present, the <b>id</b> attribute takes precedent.  The
number contained in this attribute corresponds to the Invid object
number for the object designated by this <b>&lt;object&gt;</b>
element.  The <b>num</b> attribute is used to select pre-existing
objects on the server for editing, inactivation, or deletion.  If this
<b>&lt;object&gt;</b> has an <b>action</b> attribute value that would
cause a new object to be created on the Ganymede server, the
<b>num</b> attribute is simply ignored.  It is an error to specify a <b>num</b>
attribute for an object that does not already exist on the server at
the time the xml file is processed.</dd>

<dt><b>action</b></dt>

<dd>
The <b>action</b> attribute is optional, and plays a role only in
XML data importing.  If the <b>action</b> attribute is present, it may
contain one of four strings:

<ul>
<li>create</li>
<li>edit</li>
<li>inactivate</li>
<li>delete</li>
</ul>

<p>
If there is no <b>action</b> attribute specified at import time, the
<b>&lt;object&gt;</b> element will be created if the object has a
<b>id</b> attribute and no <b>num</b> attribute and if there is no
object already on the server that matches the <b>id</b> attribute.
Otherwise, the pre-existing object on the Ganymede server matching the
identifying attribute will be checked out for editing.
</p>

<p>
If the <b>action</b> attribute is present and contains
<b>"create"</b>, the <b>&lt;object&gt;</b> element will cause the
Ganymede xmlclient to create a new object, even if an object of the
same type that matches the given <b>id</b> attribute already exists on
the server.  In addition, in such cases all <b>&lt;invid&gt;</b>
elements in the XML file with matching <b>type</b> and <b>id</b>
attributes will be interpreted to be referring to the newly created
<b>&lt;object&gt;</b> element and not any pre-existing object on the
server that might match those identifying attributes.</p>
</p>

<p>If the <b>action</b> attribute is present and contains <b>"edit"</b>,
the <b>&lt;object&gt;</b> element will cause the Ganymede xmlclient
to seek to check the object out for editing from the server.  If no
object exists on the server matching the <b>id</b> attribute, an
error will be displayed and xmlclient will abort the transaction.</p>

<p>In the unspecified, <b>"create"</b>, and <b>"edit"</b> cases, the
object element will typically contain a set of field elements.  In the
<b>"inactivate"</b> and <b>"delete"</b> cases, the
<b>&lt;object&gt;</b> element must be empty, and the xmlclient will
simply attempt to inactivate or delete the object identified by the
<b>id</b> or <b>num</b> attributes.</p>

</dd>

</dl>
</td>
</tr>
</table></center>

<p>Aside from the special case of object inactivation or deletion, all
&lt;object&gt; elements in a &lt;ganydata&gt; section will contain a
set of elements that correspond to fields in the object to be created
or edited on the server.  The elements for these fields have no fixed
tag name.  Instead, each field element will start with an open tag
that is named according to the name of the field, with spaces
transformed into underscores.</p>  

<p>For instance, a record to change the values of the "Room",
"Groups", "Home Group" and "Email Aliases" fields in a pre-existing
object on the server would be represented in the XML file as:</p>

<pre>
  &lt;object type="User" id="broccol" action="edit"&gt;
    &lt;Room&gt;S321&lt;/Room&gt;
    &lt;Groups&gt;
        &lt;invid type="Group" id="omssys"/&gt;
        &lt;invid type="Group" id="omsnet"/&gt;
    &lt;/Groups&gt;
    &lt;Home_Group&gt;&lt;invid type="Group" id="omssys"/&gt;&lt;/Home_Group&gt;
    &lt;Email_Aliases&gt;
        &lt;string val="abbey"/&gt;
        &lt;string val="jonabbey"/&gt;
    &lt;/Email_Aliases&gt;
  &lt;/object&gt;
</pre>

<p>An &lt;object&gt; element contains nothing but such field elements,
all of which lack any sort of attributes.  The field elements
themselves, however, will contain a variety of kinds of elements,
depending on the field type.  In the above example, the "Room" field
is a scalar String field, the "Groups" field is a vector Invid/object
reference field, the "Home Group" field is a scalar Invid/object
reference field, and the "Email Aliases" field is a vector String
field.</p>

<p>In the above example, the <b>Groups</b> and <b>Email_Aliases</b>
vector field elements both contain a couple of items.  These items
will be added to those fields if they are not already present, but the
xmlclient will not remove any other items which may already be in
those fields.</p>

<p>If you want to assure that after xmlclient finishes its work that
there will only be a given list of items in a vector field, you need
to do this:</p>

<pre>
  &lt;object type="User" id="broccol" action="edit"&gt;
    &lt;Room&gt;S321&lt;/Room&gt;
    &lt;Groups&gt;
        &lt;set&gt;
            &lt;invid type="Group" id="omssys"/&gt;
            &lt;invid type="Group" id="omsnet"/&gt;
        &lt;/set&gt;
    &lt;/Groups&gt;
  &lt;/object&gt;
</pre>

<p>In this example, the <b>&lt;set&gt;</b> container element will
force the xmlclient to set the <b>Groups</b> field to contain only
the two items listed, adding or removing items as necessary.</p>

<p>You can also manually add or remove individual items:</p>

<pre>
  &lt;object type="User" id="broccol" action="edit"&gt;
    &lt;Room&gt;S321&lt;/Room&gt;
    &lt;Groups&gt;
        &lt;add&gt;
            &lt;invid type="Group" id="omsovr"/&gt;
        &lt;/add&gt;
        &lt;delete&gt;
            &lt;invid type="Group" id="omsnet"/&gt;
        &lt;/delete&gt;
    &lt;/Groups&gt;
  &lt;/object&gt;
</pre>

<p>This will cause the omsovr group to be added and the omsnet group
to be removed.  You can have as many <b>&lt;add&gt;</b> and
<b>&lt;delete&gt;</b> containers as you want within a vector field,
but <b>&lt;add&gt;</b> and <b>&lt;delete&gt;</b> are not compatible
with <b>&lt;set&gt;</b>.  If you use <b>&lt;set&gt;</b>, you may
not use <b>&lt;add&gt;</b> or <b>&lt;delete&gt;</b> as well.</p>

<p>If you don't specify <b>&lt;add&gt;</b>, <b>&lt;delete&gt;</b>,
or <b>&lt;set&gt;</b>, the xmlclient will treat the items as belonging
to an <b>&lt;add&gt;</b> container.  For this reason, the following
is not allowed:</p>

<pre>
  &lt;object type="User" id="broccol" action="edit"&gt;
    &lt;Room&gt;S321&lt;/Room&gt;
    &lt;Groups&gt;
        &lt;invid type="Group" id="omsovr"/&gt;
        &lt;set&gt;
            &lt;invid type="Group" id="omssys"/&gt;
            &lt;invid type="Group" id="omsnet"/&gt;
        &lt;/set&gt;
    &lt;/Groups&gt;
  &lt;/object&gt;
</pre>

<p>because the omsovr element is considered to be in an
<b>&lt;add&gt;</b>, which may not co-exist with a <b>&lt;set&gt;</b>
in a single field element.</p>

<p>There are presently nine different types of data fields supported
by the Ganymede server, and each of these types has its own rules as
to what kinds of elements are allowed within the field element and how
they may be structured.  For the most part, these rules are very similar
for all field types, with just the value carrying element type differing.
The following table shows the data carrying element types that correspond
to the nine field types.</p>

<dd>The contents of the <b>val</b> attribute contains a human readable
representation of the time stamp held in this &lt;date&gt; element.
The <b>val</b> attribute takes data strings of the form "<b>Sun, 03
Dec 1995 00:00:00</b>", in which case the date is interpreted in the
local timezone of the machine running the xmlclient or "<b>Sun, 03 Dec
1995 00:00:00 CDT</b>", in which the date will be interpreted by the
specified timezone.  The standard UNIX date format "<b>Tue Jul 11
01:18:21 CDT 2000</b>" is also supported. The precise form of date val
string that may be parsed by the xmlclient, in particular the
characters of the date and month, may differ according to the default
Java locale of the JVM running the xmlclient.  To avoid any
possibility for imprecision, it may be necessary to instead use the
<b>timecode</b> attribute.</dd>

<dt><b>timecode</b></dt>
<dd>The contents of the <b>timecode</b> attribute contains a 64 bit
signed integer, corresponding to the number of milliseconds before or
after Midnight, January 1, 1970, UTC.  In order to use a UNIX-style 32 bit
timecode to fill in the <b>timecode</b> attribute, you can simply
multiply a 32 bit timecode by 1,000.</dd>
