	<p>The Ganymede server, like most software, is not perfect.
	   Learning how to diagnose problems and obtain debug trace
	   information is vital if you want to get your hands dirty with

    <h2>Java Failure Modes and You</h2>

    <p>Just about all of Ganymede is written in Java, which means that
    it has considerably different failure modes than you may be used
    to if you have developed software in C or C++.</p>

    <p>First of all, it is extremely rare for Java programs to crash.
    That is, it is extremely rare for a Java program to get itself
    into a state that results in a segmentation fault, bus error, or
    core dump.  If that happens to your Java program, it means that
    either the Java Virtual Machine you are using has a bug, or that
    your program is actually a Java/C or Java/C++ hybrid, in which
    Java code calls to poorly-written C or C++ libraries.  Nothing in
    Ganymede is done in this way, so any time you see a catastrophic
    program termination with a segmentation fault, bus error, or core
    dump, you should be thinking that it is a problem with your JVM,
    your operating system, or your hardware.  Ganymede may be doing
    something to expose a bug in your JVM or your operating system or
    your hardware, but it is the JVM's responsibility to keep Java
    code running correctly and safely.  Segfaulting or dumping core
    means that the JVM isn't keeping up its end of the deal.</p>

    <p>At ARL:UT, our Ganymede server regularly stays up indefinitely.
    What that means is that the server tends to keep running until the
    machine running the Ganymede server needs to be taken down for
    maintenance, or until I notice a bug in it that needs a server
    shutdown and restart to fix.  It has proven quite common for our
    Ganymede server to stay up for months at a time before one of
    these two things happens, even as we have been developing the
    server.</p>

    <p>So, if a Java program won't tend to dump core or otherwise
    suddenly terminate, how do Java programs go wrong?</p>

    <h3>Dumb Code</h3>

    <p>Well, first of all, Java programs obviously go wrong whenever
    part of the program's logic is wrong, even if the fault is not
    immediately catastrophic.  Objects in the database suddenly seem
    to vanish.  The wrong users are allowed to edit the wrong
    objects. These things are obviously unlikely to happen to you with
    such a well-written, tested, and bullet proof piece of software as
    Ganymede 2.0, but never say never.</p>
    
    <p>In those sorts of cases, the client or the server is acting
    funny, but it is still acting.  Nothing has happened that gives
    the code any reason to believe that it isn't doing exactly what it
    was told to do and that it shouldn't keep on doing it.  There's
    not much that Java or any programming language can do to rule out
    errors of this sort.  Java's object oriented structure helps
    encourage good design principles, but debugging these types of
    problems is just about the same in Java as it is in any other
    language.  Maybe a little harder in some ways, since Java programs,
    and Ganymede in particular, tend to be multithreaded.  The best
    tool I've found for debugging a lot of stuff is to edit the
    code, throw some intelligent System.err.println()'s in, and
    run through the code live and see what comes out.</p>

    <h3>Threads and Exceptions</h3>

    <p>Beyond simple Dumb Code, which does the wrong thing but does it
    more or less successfully, there is that class of errors where the
    code encounters a condition that just <b>can't</b> be right.  A
    null pointer.  An attempt to cast an object pointer to an
    incompatible type.  An attempt to loop one element past the end of
    an array.  These sorts of things are handled in a far more robust
    way in Java than in C or C++.  In Java, the thread that encounters
    such a condition throws an exception.  What that means is that the
    thread that encountered the fault goes and looks for someone to
    report the fault to.  If function A calls function B which calls
    function C, a fault that occurs inside function C might be handled
    by error checking code in function C, then in function B, then in
    function A.  If none of these functions catch the error, a general
    error reporting facility handles the problem.</p>

    <p>What this means is that it is fairly unlikely that the Ganymede
    server will ever just roll over and die.  The sorts of errors that
    would immediately kill a program in C or C++ will simply cause an
    error condition to be reported.  The thread that hit the problem
    will terminate abnormally, but all other threads in the server
    will continue on their way, and future network calls to the server
    will proceed just fine, unless they hit an error themselves.</p>

    <h3>Exception Logging</h3>

    <p>There are two places where such an error can be reported by the
    Ganymede server.  The first is to the context where the '<a
    href="glossary.html#runServer">runServer</a>' command was issued.
    If you run the '<a href="glossary.html#runServer">runServer</a>'
    script from a system boot up script, the error messages will go
    wherever you sent the <a
    href="glossary.html#runServer">runServer</a> script's command line
    output.  I recommend that you send all output from <a
    href="glossary.html#runServer">runServer</a> to a file called
    '<code>server.log</code>'.</p>

    <p>Most errors won't be reported to the command line, however.
    The reason for this is that the <a
    href="glossary.html#runServer">runServer</a> command doesn't
    directly spawn most of the threads in the running Ganymede server.
    Most of the time that the Ganymede server is doing anything, it is
    doing it because a remote client connected to it over the network
    and asked it to do something.  These error messages wind up being
    shown on the display of the client whose network request
    encountered the problem.  Since you can't watch the console of
    every client that talks to your Ganymede server, you'll want to
    have them saved on the server where you can see them. If you check
    out the <a href="glossary.html#runServer">runServer</a> script in
    your server's <code>bin</code> directory, you will see that it
    comes pre-configured to send debug output to a file called <a
    href="glossary.html#debug.log">debug.log</a>.  Whenever a Java
    error or exception occurs as a result of a client network request,
    a complete record of the event is recorded in this file.  When you
    look at this file, you will see what functions had been called
    when the fault occurred.</p>

    <p>These exception traces, whether they occur in the
    <code>server.log</code> or
    the <a href="glossary.html#debug.log">debug.log</a> file, will
    hopefully provide the information necessary for me (or you!) to
    get an idea of what might have happened.  If so, please cut and
    paste the trace information with the line numbers and file a bug
    report
    at <a href="https://tools.arlut.utexas.edu/bugzilla/index.cgi">https://tools.arlut.utexas.edu/bugzilla/index.cgi</a>
    about it.</p>

    <h3>Deadlock</h3>

    <p>Here we get to the real achilles heel of multithreaded Java
    programs, deadlock.  The Ganymede server may have dozens of
    independent threads each processing a network request or doing
    scheduled housekeeping operations.  These threads have to
    cooperate to make sure only one thread at a time is doing
    something that must not be interrupted or interfered with by
    another thread.  Whenever a thread needs to do something
    sensitive, it arranges to make sure that all other threads that
    might have an interest in doing something that would conflict with
    its activities stand aside and wait until the first thread is
    done.</p>

    <p>In a deadlock situation, two or more threads wind up waiting
    for each other to finish up so that they can proceed.  Since the
    threads are waiting for each other, no one will go anywhere.
    Everyone needing to work with the particular data structure in
    contention will have to wait forever, and more and more threads in
    the program will freeze up as they stumble into the deadly embrace
    of threads in contention.</p>

    <p>It is this sort of freeze-up that poses the real problem in
    multithreaded Java servers.  Null pointers generally can't do it,
    bad array access attempts generally can't do it, but a thread
    deadlock will bring the Ganymede server's party to a stop very
    quickly.</p>

    <p>When this happens, you'll pretty much know it, because things
    will just freeze.  New logins might not be accepted, network
    clients may become unresponsive, network builds might not get
    made.</p>

    <p>The Ganymede server was carefully designed not to get into
    deadlock, but several years ago I discovered a number of cases in
    which it was vulnerable to it.  At ARL:UT, we were using the
    server in full production for over a year before one user finally
    managed to hit 'commit' in one client at the exact same moment
    that another user was attempting to login, causing a deadlock.  If
    I hadn't been logging all RMI network requests, there would have
    been no way to determine what had happened.</p>

    <p>Because of the long time that may pass until a specific race
    condition manifests itself in deadlock, I have to assume that
    there may yet be some rare opportunity for deadlock in the current
    code.  I don't know of any today, and I have gone to considerable
    effort to eliminate even the rarest vulnerabilities to it that
    I've found, but there may still be vulnerabilities that I haven't.
    Even if there is no deadlock trap waiting in the server today, if
    you write custom plug-in classes, you might inadvertantly create a
    race condition that might lead to deadlock.  So it is worth
    talking about how to obtain useful debugging information in the
    event of a deadlock.</p>

    <p>First, a deadlock condition will generally not involve any
    exceptions being thrown.  In a deadlock, there is nothing
    obviously wrong from a given thread's perspective, it's just that
    the overall behavior of multiple threads will prevent the server
    from progressing.  Because of this, looking in the <a
    href="glossary.html#debug.log">debug.log</a> will not immediately
    show you where the problem lies.  In order to really diagnose a
    deadlock, you need to get a report of what all the threads in the
    server are doing, and which of them are waiting to get access to
    common resources.</p>

    <p>The way to do this will vary depending on the JVM you are
    using.  Sun's JVM on Solaris and Linux has a very handy feature in
    this regard.  Sending the Ganymede server process a SIGQUIT signal
    will cause the JVM running the server to print to STDOUT a
    complete list of all threads in the server, where they are, what
    they are doing, and what if anything they are waiting on.  With
    any luck, you will have started the server with its output being
    redirected to a <code>server.log</code> file, so you will have
    this output captured and ready to include in a bug report at Ganymede central for
    analysis.</p>

    <p>To do this, do a <code>ps</code> to find the Java process that
      is running the Ganymede server. Then type:</p>

    <pre>
       kill -QUIT &lt;procnum&gt;
    </pre>

    <p>where <code>&lt;procnum&gt;</code> is the process number for
    the Ganymede server.  You should see a nice long report of thread
    information added to your <code>server.log</code> file.  Go ahead
    and kill off the server (<code>kill &lt;procnum&gt;</code>), save
    the <code>server.log</code> file, and send it in for analysis.</p>

    <p>If the deadlock was triggered in response to client activity,
    you should plan on sending both the <code>server.log</code> file
    (with the thread status dump) and the <a
    href="glossary.html#debug.log">debug.log</a> files, as the <a
    href="glossary.html#debug.log">debug.log</a> file will include a
    complete record of what the clients were up to when the server
    went into deadlock.</p>

    <h3>Not My Fault!</h3>

    <p>The other class of error conditions you might run into is Not
    My Fault.  This includes things like someone pulling an ethernet
    cable out of the back of your server.  It includes things like
    having your DNS server get corrupted so that your clients can't
    find your Ganymede server.  It includes things like errors
    accidentally introduced into the external build scripts or plug-in
    classes.  Any or all of these things might result in exceptions
    being thrown in the server, and so may look like one of the other
    kinds of errors.  By all means post in the Ganymede forums with as
    much detail as you can get and share but understand that it may
    not be possible for anyone else to provide you quick answers to a
    local problem.</p>

    <p>And remember that Ganymede is licensed under the Gnu General
    Public License, and an important part of that is that there is no
    warranty or guarantee of support for Ganymede at all.  I and
    others will try to help if we can, but the only guarantee you get
    is that you are free to try and figure out problems yourself, and
    to talk to others on the net about it, and that nobody will try
    and hide something from you in the process.  Speaking personally,
    I've put way too much effort into Ganymede to see bugs go unfixed,
    so you've got at least one other party interested in problems you
    find.</p>

    <p>Best of luck bug-hunting!</p>
