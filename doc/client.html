    <h1>Ganymede client</h1>
    <blockquote>
    <p>The Ganymede client is the main interface to the Ganymede server.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <h3>Synopsis</h3>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
	<code>
	  java arlut.csd.ganymede.client.glogin properties=<u>properties_file</u> [-debug]
      </p>

      <pre>
&lt;applet archive="ganymede.jar" code="arlut.csd.ganymede.client.glogin" height=380 width=265&gt;
&lt;param ganymede.serverhost=http://www.arlut.utexas.edu/ganymede.server&gt;
&lt;/applet&gt;
      </pre>
      
    </code>
    </blockquote>


    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <blockquote>

      <p>
	glogin will open a new window with the ganymede login.  After logging in, 
	the main client window will appear.
      </p>

      <p>
	One property must be loaded in the client, <code>ganymede.serverhost</code>.  If the 
	client is run in an applet context, this property is passed in as a parameter to the
	<code>&lt;applet&gt;</code> tag.  <code>ganymede.serverhost</code> specifies the location
	of the ganymede server.
      </p>

      <p>
	glogin takes one optional parameter, <code>-debug</code>.  If present, the application
	will output extra debugging information.
      </p>

    </blockquote>

    <h3>Usage</h3>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
	There are two main areas of the client: the tree, and the
	window panel.  The tree holds a node for each object visible to
	the user.  The window panel holds the internal windows which
	allow for editing of the objects in the server.  A menu bar is
	at the top of the screen, and a status bar is at the bottom.
      </p>

      <h4>The Tree</h4>
      <blockquote>
	<p>
	  The tree acts much like the tree in the Windows Explorer.
	  Folders are opened either by clicking on the plus sign in
	  front of the folder or by double clicking on the folder or
	  the text.
	</p>

	<img src = gifs/tree.gif height=248 width=206 align=right>

	<p>
	  There are three things in the tree: categories (red folders),
	  object types (yellow folders), and objects.
	  Categories are used to organize the tree.  Object types
	  represent the basic types of information held in the
	  tree(users, groups).  Objects are the individual items in
	  the database.
	</p>

	<p>
	  Much of the tree's functionality is accessed through the
	  use of the right mouse button, or the appropriate popup-menu
	  trigger for the system.  When the right mouse button is
	  clicked a menu will be drawn over the item.  (Sometimes the
	  menu is not aligned with the tree correctly on Windows 95
	  machines.  This is a known bug in Java 1.1.5.)  The menu
	  will be different depending on the type of object clicked on
	  and the current state of the client.
	</p>

	<p>
	  By default, only editable objects are displayed in the tree.
	  In order to see all permissible objects you can choose the
	  "Show all objects" menu item on the corresponding object
	  type(yellow folder.)  This will mix in the editable and
	  non-editable objects, and the editable objects will have a
	  slightly different icon to distinguish them.
	</p>

	<p>
	  The icons for different objects in the tree can change when
	  actions are taken.  Currently, all objects currently open
	  for editing will have a pencil icon, all objects waiting to
	  be deleted have a trash can icon, and all objects currently
	  inactivated have a clock icon.  After a session is committed
	  or canceled, the icons may revert back to the original state
	  or may be removed from the tree completely.
	</p>
      </blockquote>

      <h4>The Window Panel</h4>
      <blockquote>
	<p>
	  The window panel holds all the currently open objects.  These
	  windows can be moved, iconified, maximized, and closed just
	  like normal windows.  Each window also has its own menu bar, 
	  which can be used to take actions on the object.
	</p>

	<img src= gifs/window-top.gif>

	<p>
	  The tabs just below the menu bar are used to select
	  different editing panes in the window.  The "General" tab
	  contains all the custom information.  The other tabs contain
	  various built-in fields.  "Owner" shows the owners of this
	  object.  "Notes" shows information about the creation and
	  deletion of this object, along with a text area for writing
	  notes.  A small note icon will be placed in the "Notes" tab
	  if there are any notes for this object.  The "History" tab
	  leads to a panel that allows a trace of this object's
	  history.
	</p>

	<p>
	  The "Persona" tab is only available on "User" objects.  This
	  panel allows editing of admin personae associated with the
	  user object.
	</p>

      <h4>The menu bar</h4>
      <blockquote>
	  The menu bar has five menus on it.
	<dl>
	  <dt><strong>File</strong></dt>
	  <dd>
	    <dl>
	      <dt>Clear Tree</dt>
	      <dd>Removes all the objects from the tree, so it can be rebuilt.</dd>

	      <dt>Remove All Windows</dt>
              <dd>Removes all the windows from the window panel.</dd>

	      <dt>Filter Query</dt>
              <dd>Choose a certain group to filter queries with, so the query results are not so big.</dd>

	    </dl>
	   </dd>

	  <dt><strong>Look</strong></dt>

	  </dd>
	  
	  <dt><strong>Action</strong></dt>
	  <dd>
	    <dl>
	      <dt>Query</dt>
	      <dd>Opens a new query box.</dd>

	      <dt>Edit Object</dt>
              <dd>Open an object for editing.  A dialog will prompt for the label and type of object.</dd>

	      <dt>View Object</dt>
              <dd>Open an object for viewing.  A dialog will prompt for the label and type of object.</dd>

	      <dt>Delete Object</dt>
              <dd>Delete an object.  A dialog will prompt for the label and type of object.</dd>

	      <dt>Inactivate Object</dt>
              <dd>Inactivate an object.  A dialog will prompt for the label and type of object.</dd>
	    </dl>
	  </dd>
	  
	  <dt><strong>Windows</strong></dt>
	  <dd>
	    The windows menu will contain an entry for each window
	    open in the window panel.  Choose a title, and the window
	    will be moved to the front.
	  </dd>

	  <dt><strong>Persona</strong></dt>
	  <dd>
	    Any available personas will be in this menu.  Note that if
	    a user only has one persona, the persona menu will not be
	    there.  
	  </dd>

	  <dt><strong>Help</strong></dt>
	  <dd>
	    Possibly a future online support system, but it is not
	    finished for this release.
	  </dd>
	  

	</dl>

      </blockquote>

      <h4>The status bar</h4>
      <blockquote>
	<p>
	  The status bar contains a line of text which gives feedback
	  on client operations, as well as the commit and cancel
	  buttons.  The commit and cancel buttons control what happens
	  to the changes made in the current session.
	</p>

      </blockquote>


	<p>
	  A session begins when a user first logs on, and continues
	  until the commit or cancel buttons are pressed, or the user
	  logs out.  Any changes made to the system are not committed
	  to the database until the commit button is pressed.
	</p>
