      The Ganymede server is designed to manage objects, their
      properties, and their relationships with other objects.  These
      objects typically correspond directly to entities in a network,
      such as users, groups, systems, sub-network records, and so on.
      In order to handle these objects properly, the server has to
      know how to initialize them, how to edit them, and how to delete
      them, as well as how to manage all the details along the way.
      The server has been written so that all of these details are
      handled by the <a
	href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/server/DBEditObject.html">DBEditObject</a>
      class.  <a
	href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/server/DBEditObject.html">DBEditObject</a>
      handles these details, and provides hooks to allow adopters to
      customize the management of object types by writing subclasses
      of <a
	href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/server/DBEditObject.html">DBEditObject</a>.
    </p>
    
    Among other things, <a href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/server/DBEditObject.html">DBEditObject</a> handles:

    <ul>
      <li>
	Object initialization, inactivation, reactivation, and
	deletion logic.
      </li>
      
      <li>
	Granting exceptions to the normal permissions system, such
	as allowing an admin who can edit a user to take the user
	out of a group, even if the admin wouldn't normally be able
	to edit the group.
      </li>

      <li>
	Providing a list of choices for string and <a
	href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/common/Invid.html">invid</a>
	fields.
      </li>
      
      <li>
	Overseeing all operations on fields, including the ability to
	refuse any operation on any field, the ability to make changes
	in other objects in response to operations on fields, and the
	ability to create wizard dialogs to walk the user through the
	ramifications of making certain kinds of changes to contained
	fields.
      </li>

      <li>
	Validating objects for completeness and consistency at
	transaction commit time.
      </li>

      <li>
	Taking special actions outside of the Ganymede database when
	a transaction involving a managed object type is committed.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Typically, all but the most simple of object types in the
      Ganymede database will have a custom subclass of <a
	href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/server/DBEditObject.html">DBEditObject</a>
      associated with it to manage the special requirements of that
      object type.
    </p>

      </tr>
    </table> 

    <p>
      When the Ganymede server package has been installed, you will
      typically see a 'schema' directory under the installation
      directory.  Under that is a 'custom_src' directory.  This
      directory contains build scripts 'build' and 'buildCustomJar'
      and, if you chose one of the pre-configured schema, it will
      contain a set of <b>.java</b> files.  These files are the source
      code for classes that fit into three general categories:
    </p>
      
    <ul>
      <li>
	<a href="../synchronization/index.html#buildertask">Builder classes</a>
      </li>
      
      <li>
	DBEditObject subclasses
      </li>

      <li>
	Wizard classes and other helper classes used by one of the above.
      </li>
    </ul>
      
    <p>
      At present, we are interested in the <a
	href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/server/DBEditObject.html">DBEditObject</a>
      subclasses.  The way to identify these files is simply by
      looking at the top of the file.  If a file is a <a
	href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/server/DBEditObject.html">DBEditObject</a>
      subclass, you will something similar to the following:
    </p>

    <pre>
	public class userCustom extends <a href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/server/DBEditObject.html">DBEditObject</a> implements SchemaConstants, userSchema {
    </pre>

    <p>
      When you run the 'build' script in the
      <code>schema/custom_src/</code> directory, all .java files in
      that directory will be compiled.  Then, by running the
      'buildCustomJar' script, the classes compiled from these .java
      files will be incorporated into the custom.jar file which the
      runServer script includes in the server's CLASSPATH.
    </p>

    <p>
      So, if you are creating a new schema, or creating a new
      management class for an existing object, all that you have to do
      is to create a .java file in the <code>schema/custom_src/</code>
      directory, and run the 'build' and 'buildCustomJar' scripts.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, just because the class exists and has been bound into
      the custom.jar file where the server can access it, this doesn't
      mean that the server knows about it, or knows which object type
      is to be managed by it.  This brings us to our next point.
    </p>

    <table border="1" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" width="100%">
      <tr bgcolor="#CCFFCC">
	<td colspan="1"><h2><b>How Do You Attach A Subclass To An Object Type?</b></h2></td>
      </tr>
    </table> 
    
    <p>
      You use the schema editor.  Once you have built the custom.jar
      file in the schema directory, run the admin console and choose
      the 'Edit Schema' menu item.  Once the schema editor window
      appears, click on the object type you want to manage with your
      new class, and enter the fully qualified name (package name and
      class name) of the class in the 'Name' box in the 'Class
      Information' field, as shown below.  Then click on the 'Set'
      button to register your class change with the server.
    </p>

    <img src="schema.gif" alt="Schema Diagram"/>

    <p>
      Click 'Ok', shut the server down using the admin console (don't
      just kill the server process.. the server won't remember the
      change if it has not had time to do a full dump of the
      database), start the server back up, and your class will be
      managing the object type.
    </p>

    <p>Note that the reason that the schema editor includes both a
    'Name' box and an 'Option String' box is that if you set the Name
    of the class to be
    <code>arlut.csd.ganymede.server.JythonEditObjectFactory</code>,
    and the Option String for the class to be a URI providing a
    location where a Python source file may be found, the DBEditObject
    subclass can actually be implemented in Jython. (XXX link to Ganymede/Jython docs) </p>

      Well, it will look like something like this:

package arlut.csd.ganymede.mySchemaPackage;

import arlut.csd.ganymede.server.*;
import arlut.csd.ganymede.common.*;
import arlut.csd.ganymede.rmi.*;

public class userCustom extends <a href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/server/DBEditObject.html">DBEditObject</a> {
    </pre>
      
    <p>
      The section above defines this class as being a subclass of
      <a href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/server/DBEditObject.html">DBEditObject</a>, and defines the package as
      arlut.csd.ganymede.custom.  The package could in fact be
      anything you like, but it should be consistent among your files
      to keep things clear.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      The import statement is mandatory, as the Java
      compiler needs to know where to go to look for the definition of
      the <a href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/server/DBEditObject.html">DBEditObject</a> class that we are extending,
      which is defined in package arlut.csd.ganymede.
    </p>

    <p>
      Next, we have 3 mandatory constructor definitions.  These should
      be exactly as they appear below, except the name should match
      the name of your class.  Each of these 3 constructors are used
      in the Ganymede server in different contexts, and all must
      be present.
    </p>
    
    <pre>
  /**
   *
   * Customization/objectHook PSEUDOSTATIC Constructor 
   *
   */

  public userCustom(DBObjectBase objectBase)
  {
    super(objectBase);
  }

  /**
   *
   * Create new object constructor
   *
   */

  public userCustom(DBObjectBase objectBase, Invid invid, DBEditSet editset)
  {
    super(objectBase, invid, editset);
  }

  /**
   *
   * Check-out constructor, used by DBObject.createShadow()
   * to pull out an object for editing.
   *
   */

  public userCustom(DBObject original, DBEditSet editset)
  {
    super(original, editset);
  }
    </pre>
    
    <p>
      Now we get into the meat of the subclass.. the method
      definitions.  The whole point of creating a subclass of
      <a href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/server/DBEditObject.html">DBEditObject</a> is
      to redefine methods that are called by other
      objects during the course of operation of the Ganymede server.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      In this example, we redefine one of the simplest methods in
      <a href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/server/DBEditObject.html">DBEditObject</a>,
      <a href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/server/DBEditObject.html#fieldRequired(arlut.csd.ganymede.server.DBObject, short)">fieldRequired()</a>.
      An non-redefinable method
      in <a href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/server/DBObject.html">DBObject</a>,
      <a href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/server/DBObject.html#checkRequiredFields()">checkRequiredFields()</a>,
      calls this method to see
      whether a given field must be defined when an object of this
      type is committed during the course of server's commit logic.
      By redefining <a href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/server/DBEditObject.html#fieldRequired(arlut.csd.ganymede.server.DBObject, short)">fieldRequired()</a> 
      in the subclass we are creating, we
      effectively modify how the commit operation proceeds.  In this
      case, we are telling the server what fields in a user object
      must be filled out when a transaction is committed.  Note that
      we make use of other methods defined in the server
      (<a href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/server/DBObject.html#isInactivated()">isInactivated()</a>),
      and an <a href="userSchema.java">interface</a> that we have (manually) defined
      that contains the numeric id's for the fields in our user object.
    </p>
    
    <pre>
  /**
   *
   * Customization method to control whether a specified field
   * is required to be defined at commit time for a given object.
   *
   * To be overridden in <a href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/server/DBEditObject.html">DBEditObject</a> subclasses.
   *
   * <b>*PSEUDOSTATIC*</b>
   *
   */

  public boolean fieldRequired(DBObject object, short fieldid)
  {
    // If the user has been inactivated, we don't need to have a
    // password defined for the user.  Otherwise, insist that
    // the username, uid, home directory, and login shell be
    // defined.

    if (object.isInactivated())
      {
	switch (fieldid)
	  {
	  case userSchema.USERNAME:
	  case userSchema.UID:
	  case userSchema.HOMEDIR:
	  case userSchema.LOGINSHELL:
	    return true;
	  }
      }
    else
      {
	switch (fieldid)
	  {
	  case userSchema.USERNAME:
	  case userSchema.UID:
	  case userSchema.LOGINSHELL:
	  case userSchema.HOMEDIR:
	  case userSchema.PASSWORD:
	    return true;
	  }
      }

    return false;
  }
}
    </pre>

    <p>
      Now, of course, the devil is in the details.  There are some
      basic things you need to know about how the <a href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/server/DBEditObject.html">DBEditObject</a> class
      is used in the server in order to properly approach the task of
      creating or editing your own management subclass.  First and
      foremost, you need to understand the different circumstances in
      which the Ganymede server turns to an instance of a <a href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/server/DBEditObject.html">DBEditObject</a>
      class to get things done.
    </p>
    
    <table border="1" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" width="100%">
      <tr bgcolor="#CCFFCC">
	<td colspan="1"><h2><b>DBEditObject Contexts</b></h2></td>
      </tr>
    </table> 
    
    <p>
      There are two circumstances in which a <a href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/server/DBEditObject.html">DBEditObject</a> class (or
      subclass) gets brought in to manage objects in the database.
    </p>
    
    <table>
      <tr>
	<td>
	  <p>
	    The first is when an object in the database is being examined
	    outside of the context of an editing transaction.  In this case,
	    code in the query engine, permissions code, or capabilities code
	    (is this object of a type that may be inactivated and
	    reactivated?) consult a single instance of the <a href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/server/DBEditObject.html">DBEditObject</a> class
	    or subclass that has been created in the server to serve as a
	    reference for objects of that type.
	  </p>
	</td>
	<td>
	  <img align="right" src="objecthook.gif" hspace="5" vspace="5" alt="Object Reference Context Image"/>
	</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    
    <table>
      <tr>
	<td>
	  <img src="checkedout.gif" hspace="5" vspace="5" alt="Object Editing Context Image"/>
	</td>
	<td>
	  <p>
	    The other, and more significant case in which a
	    <a href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/server/DBEditObject.html">DBEditObject</a> subclass is involved is when an object is
	    being edited.  In this case, the <a
	      href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/rmi/db_object.html">db_object</a>
	    remote handle actually references an instance of the
	    <a href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/server/DBEditObject.html">DBEditObject</a> class or subclass.  The client can actually
	    call methods (such as <a
	      href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/rmi/db_object.html#canInactivate(arlut.csd.ganymede.server.DBSession, arlut.csd.ganymede.server.DBEditObject)">
	      canInactivate()</a>) that you yourself may override in your
	    <a href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/server/DBEditObject.html">DBEditObject</a> subclass.
	  </p>
	  
	  <p>
	    For the most part, however, the methods that you will write to guide
	    the actual editing process will not be called directly by the client.
	    Instead, the methods you write will be called by the transaction logic
	    in the <a href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/server/DBEditSet.html">DBEditSet</a>
	    transaction class, or by the field objects that the client directly manipulates.
	  </p>
	</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
      
    <table>
      <tr>
	<td>
	  <p>
	    Mostly, the client will interact with your custom methods by
	    calling the ordinary remote methods defined in the 
	    <a href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/rmi/db_field.html">db_field</a>
	    remote interface.  These methods, implemented on the server in the
	    <a href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/server/DBField.html">DBField</a> class
	    and its type-specific sub-classes, call many methods in the <a href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/server/DBEditObject.html">DBEditObject</a>
	    object that they belong to in order to coordinate the editing process.
	  </p>
	</td>
	<td>
	  <img src="fieldlogic.gif" align="right" hspace="5" vspace="5" alt="Field Editing Context Image"/>
	</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    
    <p>
      The most important difference between the two cases above is
      that in the 'reference object' case, the methods you write must
      be sure not to try to examine the state of the <a
      href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/server/DBEditObject.html">DBEditObject</a>
      the methods are contained in.  Such methods are labeled
      <b>*PSEUDOSTATIC*</b>.  If you override a method labeled
      <b>*PSEUDOSTATIC*</b>, you should pretend that the method is
      static, and that you can only examine the parameters you're
      given, and anything you can find out through them, but not the
      state of the 'this' object.  Otherwise, if your code assumes that
      it can access information that 'has to be there', you may find the
      server throwing NullPointerExceptions, or worse.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the methods for customizing the editing process (the
      non-<b>*PSEUDOSTATIC*</b>, non-final methods in <a
      href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/server/DBEditObject.html">DBEditObject</a>),
      you are free to check out the current state of the <a
      href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/server/DBEditObject.html">DBEditObject</a>
      (userCustom, etc.) object your methods are called on.
      Because <a
      href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/server/DBEditObject.html">DBEditObject</a>
      is itself inherited from the basic <a
      href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/server/DBObject.html">DBObject</a>
      class used to store data in the server, you can look at the
      fields defined in the object to decide whether the overall
      context is propitious for the operation the client is
      requesting.
    </p>
      
    <p>
      In addition, because in the 'editing' methods you have a normal
      local object context, you can define whatever additional object
      fields and object methods you like to help you make the decisions
      that the customization methods may require of you.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      One more point.  The three mandatory constructors discussed in
      the example above correspond to the contexts in which a <a
      href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/server/DBEditObject.html">DBEditObject</a>
      subclass will be instantiated.  The first constructor is used
      for the reference objectHook methods, the second for when a
      wholly new object is created, and the third when an previously
      existing object is being checked out for editing.  More on the
      life and times of objects during the editing process in the next
      session.

      </tr>
    </table> 
    
    <p>
      Most of the time, <a
      href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/server/DBEditObject.html">DBEditObject</a>
      objects exist in the server because an object from the database
      is being edited by the client.  This section talks about how the
      various non-pseudostatic non-final methods in <a
      href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/server/DBEditObject.html">DBEditObject</a>
      subclasses get involved along the way from creation/check-out to
      editing to the end of an editing <a
      href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/server/DBEditObject.html">DBEditObject</a>'s
      lifetime, at transaction commit/release time.
    </p>

    <p>
      For the rest of this document, we're going to ignore the
      instance of <a
      href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/server/DBEditObject.html">DBEditObject</a>
      that is created by the server to service the pseudostatic
      methods and just talk about <a
      href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/server/DBEditObject.html">DBEditObject</a>'s
      in the editing context.
    </p>

    <table border="1" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" width="100%">
      <tr bgcolor="#CCCCFF">
	<td colspan="1" align="right"><h3><b>New Object Creation / Check-Out</b></h3></td></tr></table>

    <p>
      All objects held in the server's database have their fields defined by the
      <a href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/server/DBObjectBase.html">DBObjectBase</a>
      class.  This class is what the schema editor actually manipulates when you
      edit an object definition in the server, and it includes definitions for
      all the <a href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/server/DBObjectBaseField.html">fields</a>
      that may appear in objects of that type in the server.
    </p>

    <p>
      When a new object is created in the server, the server calls the
      second constructor shown in the example above.  The second
      constructor in any custom object is responsible for calling the
      corresponding <a
      href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/server/DBEditObject.html">DBEditObject</a>
      constructor (the <b>super()</b> constructor).  That constructor examines the <a
      href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/server/DBObjectBase.html">DBObjectBase</a>
      for that object type to determine what <a
      href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/server/DBField.html">field
      objects</a> should be constructed for the new object.  The <a
      href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/server/DBEditObject.html">DBEditObject</a>
      subclass gets a say here.  The <a
      href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/server/DBEditObject.html#instantiateNewField(short)">instantiateNewField()</a>
      method can be overridden to control whether certain fields are
      created or not.  By the time <a
      href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/server/DBEditObject.html#instantiateNewField(short)">instantiateNewField()</a>
      is called, the new <a
      href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/server/DBEditObject.html">DBEditObject</a>
      object will have gotten a reference to the <a
      href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/server/GanymedeSession.html">GanymedeSession</a>
      object containing information about the administrator's privileges, and can make decisions
      about whether a particular admin should see a particular field.
    </p>

    <p>
      One of the things that the second constructor takes is the <a
      href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/common/Invid.html">Invid</a> for
      the new object.  This is the unique, unchanging,
      <b>Invariant</b> ID for the new object.  Once this Invid is
      assigned to a new object and that object is committed into the
      database, that <a
      href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/common/Invid.html">Invid</a> will
      belong forever to that object.  It will never be re-used.
      Because of this, the server (and the client) can always use that
      <a href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/common/Invid.html">Invid</a> to
      track the newly created object, for as long as it is held in the
      database.
    </p>

    <p>
      Once the new <a
      href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/server/DBEditObject.html">DBEditObject</a> is
      created, the <a
      href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/server/DBEditObject.html#initializeNewObject()">initializeNewObject()</a>
      method is called to do whatever custom initialization logic is appropriate.
    </p>

    <p>
      If a pre-existing object is being checked out for editing, the
      process is very similar, except that the third constructor is
      called.  The new <a
      href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/server/DBEditObject.html">DBEditObject</a>
      object created will have copies of all of the fields present in
      the <a href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/server/DBObject.html">stored
      object</a> created, and any fields defined in the <a
      href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/server/DBObjectBase.html">DBObjectBase</a>
      that were not in the original will be created exactly as in the
      new object creation case.  Note that the <a
      href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/server/DBEditObject.html">DBEditObject</a> created
      from the original object does not get its own <a
      href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/common/Invid.html">Invid</a>.  The <a
      href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/server/DBEditObject.html">DBEditObject</a> does not
      have its own identity in this sense. Rather, it is a tool used to make changes
      to the original object in the database.  If you ask the <a
      href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/server/DBEditObject.html">DBEditObject</a> what
      its <a
      href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/common/Invid.html">Invid</a> is via the <a
      href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/server/DBObject.html#getInvid()">getInvid()</a>
      call, you will get back the <a
      href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/common/Invid.html">Invid</a> of the original object.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      An object in the database can only be edited by one client at a
      time. When an pre-existing object is being edited, the <a
      href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/server/DBEditObject.html">DBEditObject</a>
      object will have a <a
      href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/server/DBEditObject.html#getOriginal()">reference</a>
      to the original object, and the original object will have a
      reference to it (the shadowObject object field in <a
      href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/server/DBObject.html">DBObject</a>).
      The server checks shadowObject when an attempt is made to edit
      an object.  If shadowObject is not null, the object is already
      being edited by someone, and the edit attempt fails.
    </p>

    <p>
      Notice that the second and third constructors both take a <a
      href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/server/DBEditSet.html">DBEditSet</a>
      reference as a parameter.  This object is the transactional
      context within which this object is being created or edited.  We'll
      have more to say about the <a
      href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/server/DBEditSet.html">DBEditSet</a>
      class when we talk about <b>Transaction Commit</b>.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      In either case, creating or editing, once the new <a
      href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/server/DBEditObject.html">DBEditObject</a>
      object is created, a <a
      href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/rmi/db_object.html">remote
      reference</a> to it is passed to the client, which can then start
      editing the fields contained by the object.  But by then we are in
      the brave new world of <b>Object Editing</b>.

    <table border="1" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" width="100%">
      <tr bgcolor="#CCCCFF">
	<td colspan="1" align="right"><h3><b>Object Editing</b></h3></td></tr></table> 

    <p>
      When an object is checked out for editing, the client obtains a
      <a href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/rmi/db_object.html">remote
      reference</a> to the <a
      href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/server/DBEditObject.html">DBEditObject</a>
      and proceeds to call methods on it to obtain <a
      href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/rmi/db_field.html">db_field</a>
      remote references, which the client then calls methods on to set
      values for scalar fields, or to add, remove, or set values in
      vector fields.  This process, of the client calling methods on
      fields contained within the <a
      href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/server/DBEditObject.html">DBEditObject</a>
      object, is the way in which changes to the database are
      performed.  The client does not generally call methods on the <a
      href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/rmi/db_object.html">db_object</a>
      reference.  Everything is done to the fields.  There is one
      method, <a
      href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/rmi/db_object.html#setFieldValue(short, java.lang.Object)">setFieldValue</a>,
      that may be called on the <a
      href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/rmi/db_object.html">db_object</a>
      reference, but this is just a short cut, saving the client a
      separate remote method call to get a reference to the field to
      be changed.  All of the logic in the server is still done
      through the <a
      href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/server/DBField.html">DBField</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      The <a
      href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/server/DBEditObject.html">DBEditObject</a>
      class has many methods that get called during the process of
      changing the fields which can provide opportunities to customize
      the editing process.  Many of these methods are fairly
      straightforward, providing guidance to the <a
      href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/rmi/db_field.html">DBField</a>
      objects as to what sort of constraints should be placed on
      values and the like.  There are some methods that are worth
      calling out specially for discussion.
    </p>

    <h3>The <a href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/server/DBEditObject.html#wizardHook(arlut.csd.ganymede.server.DBField, int, java.lang.Object, java.lang.Object)">wizardHook()</a> method</h3>

    <p>
      The <a
      href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/server/DBEditObject.html#wizardHook(arlut.csd.ganymede.server.DBField, int, java.lang.Object, java.lang.Object)">wizardHook()</a>
      method is the main hook that DBEditObject subclasses use to take
      control of a requested operation on a field.  The wizardHook()
      method can refuse to perform the operation, it can take other
      actions behind the scene in response to the request, or it can
      allow the operation to proceed to completion.  <a
      href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/server/DBEditObject.html#wizardHook(arlut.csd.ganymede.server.DBField, int, java.lang.Object, java.lang.Object)">wizardHook()</a>,
      like several other <a href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/server/DBEditObject.html">DBEditObject</a>
      methods, returns a
      <a href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/common/ReturnVal.html">ReturnVal</a> object.
    </p>

    <p>
      <a
      href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/common/ReturnVal.html">ReturnVal</a>
      is the result object returned by most significant operations
      that the client can perform on the server.  A <a
      href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/common/ReturnVal.html">ReturnVal</a>
      object carries information back to the client about the success
      or failure of the operation attempted.  This information can
      include a list of objects and fields for the client to refresh,
      and it can include a <a
      href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/JDialog/JDialogBuff.html">JDialogBuff</a>
      object, and a <a
      href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/server/GanymediatorWizard.html">wizard
      callback</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      <a href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/JDialog/JDialogBuff.html">JDialogBuff</a>
      is a dialog definition object. It defines a dialog for the
      client to display, including a title, text message, an icon, an
      optional set of fields for the user to fill in, and text for the
      Ok and optional Cancel buttons.  When the client receives a <a
      href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/common/ReturnVal.html">ReturnVal</a>
      for which the <a
      href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/common/ReturnVal.html#getDialog()">getDialog()</a>
      method returns a non-null value, it will present the encoded dialog to the
      user.
    </p>

    <p>
      This can be incredibly useful if the <a
      href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/common/ReturnVal.html">ReturnVal</a> also carries a
      remote reference to a server-side <a
      href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/server/GanymediatorWizard.html">wizard</a>.  If
      this is the case, the client will wrap up the input from the user to the dialog
      in a Hashtable and send it back to the wizard, which can in return send back
      another dialog with callback, and so on.  In this way, wizard code on the server
      can walk the client through a series of dialogs along the way to completing a
      task that was originally initiated by an arbitrary operation on a field in the
      <a
	href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/server/DBEditObject.html">DBEditObject</a>.  All
      of this back-and-forth interaction happens before the client acknowledges the
      original operation on the appropriate GUI field, so at any time during this
      sequence, the wizard code on the server can return a <a
      href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/common/ReturnVal.html">ReturnVal</a> with a failure
      value to undo the original change.
    </p>

    <p>
      When the wizard code on the server finally returns a <a
      href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/common/ReturnVal.html">ReturnVal</a>
      object for which the <a
      href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/common/ReturnVal.html#didSucceed()">didSucceed()</a>
      method returns true, or for which the <a
      href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/common/ReturnVal.html#didSucceed()">didSucceed()</a>
      method returns false and the <a
      href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/common/ReturnVal.html#getCallback()">getCallback()</a>
      method returns null, the wizard sequence is considered finished.  If the 
      final ReturnVal's didSucceed method does return true, the client will check
      the <a href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/common/ReturnVal.html">ReturnVal</a> object for
      refresh/rescan information.  In this way, the wizard code on the server can make
      changes throughout the database and the client will update its display to
      reflect the changes made.
    </p>

    <p>
      Writing wizards and <a
      href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/server/DBEditObject.html#wizardHook(arlut.csd.ganymede.server.DBField, int, java.lang.Object, java.lang.Object)">wizardHook()</a>
      methods can be somewhat tricky.  See the <a href="wizards.html">Ganymede Wizard Guide</a>
    for details on the wizard process.  You can also
      look at a couple of examples from the GASH schema: a <a
      href="userRenameWizard.java">user rename wizard</a> and a <a
      href="userHomeGroupDelWizard.java">home group deletion
      wizard</a>, along with the DBEditObject subclass <a
      href="userCustom.java">userCustom</a> whose wizardHook() method
      creates and manages the wizards.

    <h3>The finalize methods</h3>

    <p>
      The 
      <a href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/server/DBEditObject.html#finalizeSetValue(arlut.csd.ganymede.server.DBField, java.lang.Object)">finalizeSetValue()</a>,
      <a href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/server/DBEditObject.html#finalizeSetElement(arlut.csd.ganymede.server.DBField, int, java.lang.Object)">finalizeSetElement()</a>,
      <a href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/server/DBEditObject.html#finalizeAddElement(arlut.csd.ganymede.server.DBField, java.lang.Object)">finalizeAddElement()</a>, and
      <a href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/server/DBEditObject.html#finalizeDeleteElement(arlut.csd.ganymede.server.DBField, int)">finalizeDeleteElement()</a>
      methods provide hooks to allow you to have final oversight when a field is actually changed.  These methods
      can return a <a href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/common/ReturnVal.html">ReturnVal</a> object with
      a false success value to refuse the operation, but more generally these methods are used
      not to refuse an operation, but rather to take contingent actions to other objects or other
      fields within the same object.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      The reason you would one of the finalize methods instead of the
      <a
      href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/server/DBEditObject.html#wizardHook(arlut.csd.ganymede.server.DBField, int, java.lang.Object, java.lang.Object)">wizardHook()</a>
      method is that you might want it to always be called when a
      field changes, whereas the <a
      href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/server/DBEditObject.html#wizardHook(arlut.csd.ganymede.server.DBField, int, java.lang.Object, java.lang.Object)">wizardHook()</a>
      method is bypassed if the server changes a field directly using
      the <a
      href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/server/DBField.html#setValueLocal(java.lang.Object)">DBField.setValueLocal()</a>
      method, etc.  The <a
      href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/server/DBEditObject.html#wizardHook(arlut.csd.ganymede.server.DBField, int, java.lang.Object, java.lang.Object)">wizardHook()</a>
      method is really designed to interact with the user to pass back
      dialogs and/or field rescan information.  The finalize methods
      are the very last thing done before a change to a field is
      finalized, and so is the best place to put code to be executed
      whenever the field is changed, regardless of whether it was done
      by direct interaction with the client, by server-side wizard
      code, or anything else.
    </p>

    <p>
      The <a
      href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/server/DBEditObject.html#wizardHook(arlut.csd.ganymede.server.DBField, int, java.lang.Object, java.lang.Object)">wizardHook()</a> and
      finalize methods in a <a
      href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/server/DBEditObject.html">DBEditObject</a> can have a fairly
      complex and incestuous relationship, with the <a
      href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/server/DBEditObject.html#wizardHook(arlut.csd.ganymede.server.DBField, int, java.lang.Object, java.lang.Object)">wizardHook()</a> method
      doing initial review of the operation, and the appropriate finalize method taking assorted 
      actions once the operation is approved.
    </p>
      
    <p>
      Actually, there's another very important difference between <a
      href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/server/DBEditObject.html#wizardHook(arlut.csd.ganymede.server.DBField, int, java.lang.Object, java.lang.Object)">wizardHook()</a>
      and the finalize methods.  And that is that the finalize methods
      are called after all default validity checking is performed.
      For instance, if the client tries to rename a user, the <a
      href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/server/DBEditObject.html#wizardHook(arlut.csd.ganymede.server.DBField, int, java.lang.Object, java.lang.Object)">wizardHook()</a>
      method will be called to approve the operation up front, but the
      <a
      href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/server/DBEditObject.html#wizardHook(arlut.csd.ganymede.server.DBField, int, java.lang.Object, java.lang.Object)">wizardHook()</a>'s
      approval doesn't mean the operation will actually be done.  The
      default <a
      href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/server/DBField.html">DBField()</a>
      and <a
      href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/server/DBEditObject.html">DBEditObject</a>
      logic checks the submitted value against the field's constraints
      (using many of the methods in <a
      href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/server/DBEditObject.html">DBEditObject</a>),
      and against the controlling <a
      href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/server/DBNameSpace.html">namespace</a>,
      if any.  If it is an <a
      href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/server/InvidDBField.html">Invid
      field</a>, the old and/or new link targets will be bound
      together via the bi-directional linking logic.  By the time the
      appropriate finalize method is called, the server logic has
      validated everything about the operation aside from the custom
      <a
      href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/server/DBEditObject.html">DBEditObject</a>'s
      sign-off.  The finalize methods are always the last word on the operation, and
      you can be sure that if one of your finalize methods is called, the server <b>will</b>
      make the change if its <a href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/common/ReturnVal.html">ReturnVal</a>'s
      <a href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/common/ReturnVal.html#didSucceed()">didSucceed()</a>
      method returns <code>true</code>.

    <table border="1" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" width="100%">
      <tr bgcolor="#CCCCFF">
	<td colspan="1" align="right"><h3><b>Transaction Commit</b></h3></td></tr></table> 

    <p>
      All editable <a
      href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/server/DBEditObject.html">DBEditObjects</a>
      exist in the context of a Ganymede transaction, which is
      represented in the server by a <a
      href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/server/DBEditSet.html">DBEditSet</a>
      object.  When a transaction is committed, the <a
      href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/server/DBEditObject.html">DBEditObjects</a>
      are converted into <a
      href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/server/DBObject.html">DBObjects</a>
      and stored in the Ganymede object tables.  There are a few methods defined
      in <a
      href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/server/DBEditObject.html">DBEditObject</a>
      that are specifically designed to allow for transactions in Ganymede to be
      tied to transactions in other databases, or to other external actions.
    </p>

    <p>
      When a transaction is committed, the first thing the server does
      is to check each object in the transaction by consulting the <a
      href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/server/DBEditObject.html#fieldRequired(arlut.csd.ganymede.server.DBObject, short)">fieldRequired()</a>
      method to make sure that all required fields for each object
      actually are defined.  If one or more objects do not have fields
      defined that the object's <a
      href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/server/DBEditObject.html#fieldRequired(arlut.csd.ganymede.server.DBObject, short)">fieldRequired()</a>
      method reports as being required, the commit will fail, and the client will
      be given a list of objects and fields that need to be filled out.
    </p>

    <p>
      Once all objects have had their fields checked, Ganymede progresses into its formal 
      transaction commit logic.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Ganymede server uses a <b>two phase commit protocol</b> to handle transaction commit.  What
      this means is simply that the server first checks all objects involved in the transaction and
      asks them if they are ok for commit, using the <a
      href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/server/DBEditObject.html#commitPhase1()">commitPhase1()</a> method.
      If all of the objects in the transaction confirm that they are ok to be checked back in, the
      server goes back through all the objects and calls <a
      href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/server/DBEditObject.html#commitPhase2()">commitPhase2()</a> on them.
    </p>

    <p>
      If, instead, one of the objects reported that it was <b>not</b> ready to be checked in when its
      <a
      href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/server/DBEditObject.html#commitPhase1()">commitPhase1()</a> method
      was called, the server will go through all the objects in the transaction and call the <a
      href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/server/DBEditObject.html#release(boolean)">release()</a> method on the
      objects, instead.
    </p>

    <p>
      The two phase commit protocol allows transactions to be
      coordinated between multiple databases.  The <a
      href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/server/DBEditObject.html#commitPhase1()">commitPhase1()</a>
      method for an object might talk to an external transactional
      database, for example, making changes in that database to
      reflect the changes made to the object in the Ganymede
      transaction.  If that external database refused the change, the <a
      href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/server/DBEditObject.html#commitPhase1()">commitPhase1()</a>
      method would return false, blocking the incompatible Ganymede transaction from being
      committed.
    </p>

    <p>
      If all of the objects in the transaction give their OK, objects whose <a
      href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/server/DBEditObject.html#commitPhase1()">commitPhase1()</a>
      methods initiated external transactions will commit those transactions when their <a
      href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/server/DBEditObject.html#commitPhase2()">commitPhase2()</a>
      methods are called. If, instead, their <a
      href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/server/DBEditObject.html#release(boolean)">release()</a>
      methods are called, they would abort their remote transactions.
    </p>

    <p>
      Note that if you want to take a <b>non-transactional external
      action</b> on commit (such as creating a user's home directory
      when a new user is created), you should do so in <a
      href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/server/DBEditObject.html#commitPhase2()">commitPhase2()</a>,
      not in <a
      href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/server/DBEditObject.html#commitPhase1()">commitPhase1()</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      In any case, your <a
      href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/server/DBEditObject.html#commitPhase1()">commitPhase1()</a>,
      <a
      href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/server/DBEditObject.html#commitPhase2()">commitPhase2()</a>,
      and <a
      href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/server/DBEditObject.html#release(boolean)">release()</a>
      methods will need to be able to tell what happened to the object
      during the transaction.  There are two parts to this.  The first
      is by the use of the <a
      href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/server/DBEditObject.html#getStatus()">getStatus()</a>
      method, which can tell you if the object has been newly created,
      edited, or deleted.  The second method you should use to
      determine what has happened during the transaction is the <a
      href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/server/DBEditObject.html#getOriginal()">getOriginal()</a>
      method, which will give you a reference to the object as it
      existed before it was checked out for editing.  You can then
      compare the values of various fields in the original and the
      fields in the <a
      href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/server/DBEditObject.html">DBEditObject</a>
      being committed, and make your decision as to what action needs
      to be taken in each of the two-phase commit methods based on
      that information.
    </p>

    <p>
      Of course, since you are subclassing <a
      href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/server/DBEditObject.html">DBEditObject</a> to customize
      the two-phase commit logic anyway, you can always define new variables in your subclass
      to keep track of things, either between  <a
      href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/server/DBEditObject.html#commitPhase1()">commitPhase1()</a>,
      <a
      href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/server/DBEditObject.html#commitPhase2()">commitPhase2()</a>,
      and <a
      href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/server/DBEditObject.html#release(boolean)">release()</a> methods, or by
      having the various finalize methods keep notes as to what has been done as the user edits
      the object.  You have a lot of flexibility as to how you implement your logic, be creative.
    </p>

    <p>
      One word of caution.. it is possible to dead-lock the Ganymede server from within the
    <a
      href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/server/DBEditObject.html#commitPhase1()">commitPhase1()</a>,
    <a
      href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/server/DBEditObject.html#commitPhase2()">commitPhase2()</a>,
    and <a
      href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/server/DBEditObject.html#release(boolean)">release()</a> methods,
    as portions of the database are locked during the time that these methods are executing.
    Under no circumstances should you use any methods that involve locks in GanymedeSession
    from within these methods.  In particular, it is forbidden to use any GanymedeSession
    methods that involve the GanymedeSession query system, including the otherwise tempting
    findLabeledObject() method.</p>

    <p>
      Of course, if you are not doing something special, you shouldn't have to
      override any of these methods.  The default <a
      href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/server/DBEditObject.html#commitPhase1()">commitPhase1()</a>
      method defined in <a
      href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/server/DBEditObject.html">DBEditObject</a>
      will call <a
      href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/server/DBEditObject.html#consistencyCheck(arlut.csd.ganymede.server.DBObject)">consistencyCheck()</a>
      to verify the object's state, so by overriding <a
      href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/server/DBEditObject.html#consistencyCheck(arlut.csd.ganymede.server.DBObject)">consistencyCheck()</a>
      you can gain control over whether an object is fit to be checked into the database without
      having to mess with the two-phase stuff.

      In addition to everything else, the <a
      href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/server/DBEditObject.html">DBEditObject</a>
      class is involved when an object in the database is inactivated,
      reactivated, or removed from the database.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      When an object is inactivated, reactivated, or removed, the
      server checks the object out of the database for editing, and
      calls the <a
      href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/server/DBEditObject.html#inactivate()">inactivate()</a>,
      <a
      href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/server/DBEditObject.html#reactivate()">reactivate()</a>,
      and/or <a
      href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/server/DBEditObject.html#remove()">remove()</a>
      methods on the object.  These methods may be overridden to
      perform special actions on object inactivation, reactivation,
      and removal.  These methods should only take action within the
      Ganymede server itself.  Any special external actions to
      accompany these actions should be checked for and performed in
      the <a
      href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/server/DBEditObject.html#commitPhase1()">commitPhase1()</a>
      or <a
      href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/server/DBEditObject.html#commitPhase2()">commitPhase2()</a>
      methods when the transaction in which the object was changed is
      committed.  Typically, the <a
      href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/server/DBEditObject.html#inactivate()">inactivate()</a> method
      will set the removal date for the object, and you can look for this in your commit
      logic if you need to perform external actions for inactivated or reactivated objects.

	  This method is called whenever any fields in this object are

	  whether to allow it to proceed normally, to reject the
	  operation outright, to do some other operation instead of
	  the requested one, or to start a wizard process to handle
	  things interactively with the user.<br/><br/>
	  
	  This method is called before any of the finalize methods
	  listed below.  The finalize methods represent the last
	  possible chance to refuse an operation, with just a yes/no
	  result.  wizardHook allows the operation to be redirected

	  <a href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/server/DBEditObject.html#preCommitHook()">preCommitHook()</a>
	</td>
	<td>
          This method provides a pre-commit hook that runs after the user
          has hit commit but before the system has established write locks
          for the commit.<br/><br/>
   
          The intended purpose of this hook is to allow objects that
          dynamically maintain hidden label fields to update those fields
          from the contents of the object's other fields at commit time.<br/><br/>
   
          This method runs in a checkpointed context.  If this method
          fails in any operation, you should return a ReturnVal with a
          failure dialog encoded, and the transaction's commit will be
          blocked, the checkpoint is rolled back, and a dialog
          explaining the problem will be presented to the
          user.<br/><br/>

	<td>
	  This method performs verification for the first phase of
	  the two-phase commit algorithm.  If this object returns
	  true from commitPhase1() when called during an editSet's
	  commit() routine, this object CAN NOT refuse commit()
	  at a subsequent point.  Once commitPhase1() is called,
	  the object CAN NOT be changed until the transaction
	  is either fully committed or abandoned. <br/><br/>

	  This method is intended to be subclassed by application
	  objects that need to include extra-Ganymede processes
	  in the two-phase commit protocol.  If a particular
	  subclass of DBEditObject does not need to involve outside
	  processes in the full two-phase commit protocol, this
	  method should not be overridden.<br/><br/>

          Beware.. it can cause a server dead-lock to call GanymedeSession
          Query methods from within this method.

	  This method is a hook for subclasses to override to
	  pass the phase-two commit command to external processes.<br/><br/>

	  For normal usage this method would not be overridden.  For
	  cases in which change to an object would result in an external
	  process being initiated whose success or failure would not
	  affect the successful commit of this DBEditObject in the
	  Ganymede server, the process invokation should be placed here,
	  rather than in commitPhase1().<br/><br/>
