Ganymede Release 2.0
29 June 2013
CREDITS

---------------------------------------------

Ganymede has been under development for over 15 years now, in both
planning and execution.  The work has primarily been performed in the
Information Technology Services Division of the Applied Research
Laboratories at the University of Texas at Austin, with support from
division and laboratory management.

The development of Ganymede has benefited from the direct
development contributions of the following individuals:

--

 Jonathan Abbey, jonabbey@arlut.utexas.edu

Primary architect and coder on the project.  Designed and implemented
the Ganymede server and admin console, the table and tree GUI
components used in both the admin console and the primary client, the
great bulk of the project documentation (or lack thereof) as well as
much of the Git and build script work.  Answers e-mail.

--

 Deepak Giridharagopal

While working at ARL, Deepak made extensive contributions to the
development of Ganymede 2.0, including transitioning Ganymede's build
system from old Perl scripts to using Ant.  Deepak also developed the
Jython integration, and worked on the new Sync Channel software, both
in the Ganymede client and especially in the amazing Python Sync
Channel servicing code framework, known as SyncUtil, which forms the
basis of the gasharl schema kit's support for efficient sync'ing to
Active Directory.

Deepak also designed and implemented the Ganymede 2.0 Query Language,
using Terrance Parr's splendiferously good ANTLR tool.

--

 Dan Scott

Dan originated the GASH project, providing strategic vision and
architectural design to solve the essential problem of shared group
control over the lab's master NIS and DNS databases.  Dan has
contributed greatly to the higher level design issues in Ganymede, as
well as providing invaluable user interface design feedback and bug
reporting.  Neither Ganymede nor GASH could have been developed at all
without his support.

--

 Mike Mulvaney

Mike worked on Ganymede during his year and a half at the lab, from
February of 1997 through September of 1998, before moving to the
Washington D.C. area.  Significant amounts of the client remain
primarily Mike's work.  In addition to the large bulk of client-side
coding, Mike contributed significantly to the design of the system
architecture as a whole.  Ganymede would be a far poorer thing were it
not for Mike.

--

 Brian O'Mara

Brian worked on Ganymede during his tenure as a student employee at
ARL from February 1998 through August of 2000.  Brian created custom
icons for the Ganymede client and rewrote the permissions editor to
use more Swing classes, as well as creating the persona selection
dialog introduced in Ganymede 0.98.  Brian also reworked the Query
dialog to be more user-friendly.  During his last year at ARL, Brian
did an enormous amount of work in preparing for the ultimate
replacement of the old-style hosts_info DNS support with new code to
convert BIND files into an XML representation and back again.

As if that wasn't enough, Brian also created the Ganymede logo as well
as many of the icons used in the Ganymede clients.

--

 Navin Manohar

Navin worked on Ganymede from its inception in late 1995 through his
departure from the lab in April of 1997.  Navin contributed to initial
architecture design decisions during this time, as well as the initial
development of the client, including the basic framework within which
the client was developed.  He developed the excellent calendar GUI
component that is used in the client, as well as the more unobtrusive
but vital GUI components that the client used for data entry, way back
in the Java 1.0 days.

--

 James Ratcliff

James replaced the ARL-written baseTable, gridTable, and rowTable
classes used in the Ganymede client with a new SmartTable class that
wraps the javax.swing.JTable class with a compatible interface.  This
work has made report printing possible in Ganymede.

James also provided the port of Ulrich Drepper's Unix SHA256, SHA512
crypt algorithms to Java that is used in Ganymede for secure password
hashing.

--

 Erik Grostic

Erik worked on Ganymede from mid 1997 through his departure
from the lab in December of 1997.  Erik developed the GUI code for the
permissions editor and the query submission dialog, helping bring the
client into fruition.

------

Within ARL, Gil Kloepfer provided design assistance on the networking
issues that Ganymede was designed to address as the lab moved into the
21st century.  Marcus Walker and Tania Ayala made very helpful user
interface recommendations and bug reports.  Marcus also helped
designed the gasharl schema's support for Active Directory constructs.
Jay Scott contributed work on the build script environment used to
propagate data from Ganymede into the laboratory's information
systems.  GASH admins Mark Parker, Glen Kronschnabl, Carrie Woodworth,
Rich Gramann, Andrew Helyer, Richard Mach, Randy Zagar, and many
others made helpful reports on gaps and problems with Ganymede.

John Knutson has provided bug reports and code contributions in the
course of evaluating the Ganymede code for use on an SGL
project.  Ganymede's support of floating point data fields came
from John.

A lot of Ganymede is based on the experience and design work
that went into GASH.  In addition to the aforementioned names, Dean
Kennedy and Pug Bainter should be credited for their design work on
GASH.  Pug Bainter authored the original GASH makefiles that the
Ganymede GASH schema uses to propagate information from
Ganymede into NIS and DNS.

The Java implementation of the standard UNIX crypt() function was
converted from C by John Dumas, johnfdumas@gmail.com, whose code can
be found at http://www.vulcanware.com/java_jcrypt/index.html.  jcrypt
is included in Ganymede by permission of the author.

--

The Qsmtp class was originally written by James Driscoll
(maus@io.com), and placed into the public domain.  See
http://www.io.com/~maus/JavaPage.html for details and additional free
Java code. Note that the version of Qstmp packaged with Ganymede has
been significantly modified, to provide more convenient use in a
threaded context, and to provide rudimentary MIME file attachment
support.

--

The MD5Crypt class used to support FreeBSD-style md5 passwords was
originally written by Poul-Henning Kamp (phk@login.dknet.dk) in C, and
was translated into Java by Jonathan Abbey.. the following license
information was placed on the original code:

   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
   "THE BEER-WARE LICENSE" (Revision 42):
   <phk@login.dknet.dk> wrote this file.  As long as you retain this notice you
   can do whatever you want with this stuff. If we meet some day, and you think
   this stuff is worth it, you can buy me a beer in return.   Poul-Henning Kamp
   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

--

The MD4 class used to support Windows NT-compatible cryptographic
hashes was derived from MD classes written by Harry Mantakos,
harry@meretrix.com, and are here under Harry's "there's code in here
that you're welcome to steal" license.  The MD classes came from
Harry's JOTP project, which you can link to at
http://www.cs.umd.edu/users/harry/jotp/.

The actual "LANMAN" and "NT MD4 Unicode" hash support code was written
by Andrew Tridgell and released under the GPL as part of the Samba
source code, and was ported to Java by Jonathan Abbey, using Harry's
MD4 code to perform the fundamental cryptographic hash function.

Note that Sun has declined to provide support for md4 in the
java.security.MessageDigest class.  This is because md4 is terribly
weak by modern standards, but if you want to support old school Lan
Manager password hashes, that's what you have to use.

--

The Unix SHA Crypt algorithms embodied in the
arlut.csd.crypto.Sha256Crypt and arlut.csd.crypto.Sha512Crypt classes
come from Ulrich Drepper, who released the algorithms into the public
domain.  See http://people.redhat.com/drepper/sha-crypt.html for a
discussion of details.  The port was performed by James Ratcliff,
falazar@arlut.utexas.edu.

Unlike md4, the hashing used for the Unix SHA Crypt standard is
phenomenally strong, and you should probably try to use this if you're
generating hashed passwords for modern Linux, Solaris, AIX, or HPUX
systems.

The Ganymede client makes use of the Foxtrot project
(http://foxtrot.sourceforge.net/) by Simone Bordet, a very nifty GUI
threading tool that allows us to synchronously decouple the client's
GUI thread from certain kinds of long-standing network activity on the
client while allowing the GUI thread to dispatch GUI events until the
network activity is done.  The Foxtrot project is included in the
Ganymede clients under the BSD license.
