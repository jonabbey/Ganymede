# this template is used to provide the subject for email summarizing
# multiple instances of a given operation in a single transaction,
# when the recipient has asked to be notified of operations of that
# type.
#
# an example would be when an admin deletes 5 users in one go.  A person
# who has configured an ObjectEvent entry in Ganymede to send him email
# whenever a user is deleted would receive a single email whose subject
# would look like
#
# Ganymede: User Deleted (x5)
#
# where "Ganymede: " is {0}, "User Deleted" is {1} (it comes from the
# descriptive title the user put when configuring the ObjectEvent
# object), and 5 is {2}.
