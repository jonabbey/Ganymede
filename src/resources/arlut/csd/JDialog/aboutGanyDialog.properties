init.creditsText = <html>Ganymede Release 2.0<br>8 February 2012<br>CREDITS<br><br>---------------------------------------------<br><br>Ganymede has been under development for over 15 years now, in both<br>planning and execution.  The work has primarily been performed in the<br>Information Technology Services Division of the Applied Research<br>Laboratories at the University of Texas at Austin, with support from<br>division and laboratory management.<br><br>The development of Ganymede has benefited from the direct<br>development contributions of the following individuals:<br><br>--<br><br> Jonathan Abbey, jonabbey@arlut.utexas.edu<br><br>Primary architect and coder on the project.  Designed and implemented<br>the Ganymede server and admin console, the table and tree GUI<br>components used in both the admin console and the primary client, the<br>great bulk of the project documentation (or lack thereof) as well as<br>much of the Git and build script work.  Answers e-mail.<br><br>--<br><br> Deepak Giridharagopal<br><br>While working at ARL, Deepak made extensive contributions to the<br>development of Ganymede 2.0, including transitioning Ganymede''s build<br>system from old Perl scripts to using Ant.  Deepak also developed the<br>Jython integration, and worked on the new Sync Channel software, both<br>in the Ganymede client and especially in the amazing Python Sync<br>Channel servicing code framework, known as SyncUtil, which forms the<br>basis of the gasharl schema kit''s support for efficient sync''ing to<br>Active Directory.<br><br>Deepak also designed and implemented the Ganymede 2.0 Query Language,<br>using Terrance Parr''s splendiferously good ANTLR tool.<br><br>--<br><br> Dan Scott<br><br>Dan originated the GASH project, providing strategic vision and<br>architectural design to solve the essential problem of shared group<br>control over the lab''s master NIS and DNS databases.  Dan has<br>contributed greatly to the higher level design issues in Ganymede, as<br>well as providing invaluable user interface design feedback and bug<br>reporting.  Neither Ganymede nor GASH could have been developed at all<br>without his support.<br><br>--<br><br> Mike Mulvaney<br><br>Mike worked on Ganymede during his year and a half at the lab, from<br>February of 1997 through September of 1998, before moving to the<br>Washington D.C. area.  Significant amounts of the client remain<br>primarily Mike''s work.  In addition to the large bulk of client-side<br>coding, Mike contributed significantly to the design of the system<br>architecture as a whole.  Ganymede would be a far poorer thing were it<br>not for Mike.<br><br>--<br><br> Brian O''Mara<br><br>Brian worked on Ganymede during his tenure as a student employee at<br>ARL from February 1998 through August of 2000.  Brian created custom<br>icons for the Ganymede client and rewrote the permissions editor to<br>use more Swing classes, as well as creating the persona selection<br>dialog introduced in Ganymede 0.98.  Brian also reworked the Query<br>dialog to be more user-friendly.  During his last year at ARL, Brian<br>did an enormous amount of work in preparing for the ultimate<br>replacement of the old-style hosts_info DNS support with new code to<br>convert BIND files into an XML representation and back again.<br><br>As if that wasn''t enough, Brian also created the Ganymede logo as well<br>as many of the icons used in the Ganymede clients.<br><br>--<br><br> Navin Manohar<br><br>Navin worked on Ganymede from its inception in late 1995 through his<br>departure from the lab in April of 1997.  Navin contributed to initial<br>architecture design decisions during this time, as well as the initial<br>development of the client, including the basic framework within which<br>the client was developed.  He developed the excellent calendar GUI<br>component that is used in the client, as well as the more unobtrusive<br>but vital GUI components that the client used for data entry, way back<br>in the Java 1.0 days.<br><br>--<br><br> James Ratcliff<br><br>James replaced the ARL-written baseTable, gridTable, and rowTable<br>classes used in the Ganymede client with a new SmartTable class that<br>wraps the javax.swing.JTable class with a compatible interface.  This<br>work has made report printing possible in Ganymede.<br><br>James also provided the port of Ulrich Drepper''s Unix SHA256, SHA512<br>crypt algorithms to Java that is used in Ganymede for secure password<br>hashing.<br><br>--<br><br> Erik Grostic<br><br>Erik worked on Ganymede from mid 1997 through his departure<br>from the lab in December of 1997.  Erik developed the GUI code for the<br>permissions editor and the query submission dialog, helping bring the<br>client into fruition.<br><br>------<br><br>Within ARL, Gil Kloepfer provided design assistance on the networking<br>issues that Ganymede was designed to address as the lab moved into the<br>21st century.  Marcus Walker and Tania Ayala made very helpful user<br>interface recommendations and bug reports.  Marcus also helped<br>designed the gasharl schema''s support for Active Directory constructs.<br>Jay Scott contributed work on the build script environment used to<br>propagate data from Ganymede into the laboratory''s information<br>systems.  GASH admins Glen Kronschnabl, Carrie Woodworth, Rich<br>Gramann, Andrew Helyer, Richard Mach, Randy Zagar, and many others<br>made helpful reports on gaps and problems with Ganymede.<br><br>John Knutson has provided bug reports and code contributions in the<br>course of evaluating the Ganymede code for use on an SGL<br>project.  Ganymede''s support of floating point data fields came<br>from John.<br><br>A lot of Ganymede is based on the experience and design work<br>that went into GASH.  In addition to the aforementioned names, Dean<br>Kennedy and Pug Bainter should be credited for their design work on<br>GASH.  Pug Bainter authored the original GASH makefiles that the<br>Ganymede GASH schema uses to propagate information from<br>Ganymede into NIS and DNS.<br><br>Outside ARL, we have gotten very helpful bug reports and feedback<br>from:<br><br>Pug Bainter - lots of really good early bug reports<br>Martin Schneider - server customization bug reports<br>Michael McEniry - linux localhost patch<br>Christoph Litauer - xmlclient testing<br>Curtis King - detailed bug reports<br>Doug Floyd - bug reports and AIX testing<br>Matt Knopp - Early FreeBSD testing, Sesame Chicken<br>Mike Clay - Early FreeBSD testing<br>Stephen L.

See<br><a href=\"http://www.io.com/~maus/JavaPage.html\">http://www.io.com/~maus/JavaPage.html</a> for details and additional free<br>Java code. Note that the version of Qstmp packaged with Ganymede has<br>been significantly modified, to provide more convenient use in a<br>threaded context, and to provide rudimentary MIME file attachment<br>support.<br><br>--<br><br>The MD5Crypt class used to support FreeBSD-style md5 passwords was<br>originally written by Poul-Henning Kamp (phk@login.dknet.dk) in C, and<br>was translated into Java by Jonathan Abbey.. the following license<br>information was placed on the original code:<br><br>   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>   "THE BEER-WARE LICENSE" (Revision 42):<br>   <phk@login.dknet.dk> wrote this file.  As long as you retain this notice you<br>   can do whatever you want with this stuff. If we meet some day, and you think<br>   this stuff is worth it, you can buy me a beer in return.   Poul-Henning Kamp<br>   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>--<br><br>The MD4 class used to support Windows NT-compatible cryptographic<br>hashes was derived from MD classes written by Harry Mantakos,<br>harry@meretrix.com, and are here under Harry''s "there''s code in here<br>that you''re welcome to steal" license.  The MD classes came from<br>Harry''s JOTP project, which you can link to at<br><a href=\"http://www.cs.umd.edu/users/harry/jotp/\">http://www.cs.umd.edu/users/harry/jotp/</a>.<br><br>The actual "LANMAN" and "NT MD4 Unicode" hash support code was written<br>by Andrew Tridgell and released under the GPL as part of the Samba<br>source code, and was ported to Java by Jonathan Abbey, using Harry''s<br>MD4 code to perform the fundamental cryptographic hash function.<br><br>Note that Sun has declined to provide support for md4 in the<br>java.security.MessageDigest class.  This is because md4 is terribly<br>weak by modern standards, but if you want to support old school Lan<br>Manager password hashes, that''s what you have to use.<br><br>--<br><br>The Unix SHA Crypt algorithms embodied in the<br>arlut.csd.crypto.Sha256Crypt and arlut.csd.crypto.Sha512Crypt classes<br>come from Ulrich Drepper, who released the algorithms into the public<br>domain.  See <a href=\"http://people.redhat.com/drepper/sha-crypt.html\">http://people.redhat.com/drepper/sha-crypt.html</a> for a<br>discussion of details.  The port was performed by James Ratcliff,<br>falazar@arlut.utexas.edu.<br><br>Unlike md4, the hashing used for the Unix SHA Crypt standard is<br>phenomenally strong, and you should probably try to use this if you''re<br>generating hashed passwords for modern Linux, Solaris, AIX, or HPUX<br>systems.<br><br>--<br><br>The BCrypt implementation included in Ganymede (org.mindrot.BCrypt) is<br>copyright 2006 by Damien Miller <djm@mindrot.org>, under the BSD<br>license:<br><br>/*<br> * Copyright (c) 2006 Damien Miller <djm@mindrot.org><br> *<br> * Permission to use, copy, modify, and distribute this software for any<br> * purpose with or without fee is hereby granted, provided that the above<br> * copyright notice and this permission notice appear in all copies.<br> *<br> * THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND THE AUTHOR DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES<br> * WITH REGARD TO THIS SOFTWARE INCLUDING ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF<br> * MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS.

This License applies to any program or other work which contains<br>a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed<br>under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,<br>refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"<br>means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:<br>that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,<br>either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another<br>language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in<br>the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".<br><br>Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not<br>covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of<br>running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program<br>is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the<br>Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).<br>Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.<br><br>  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program''s<br>source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you<br>conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate<br>copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the<br>notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;<br>and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License<br>along with the Program.<br><br>You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and<br>you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.<br><br>  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion<br>of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and<br>distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1<br>above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:<br><br>a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices<br>stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.<br><br>b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in<br>whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any<br>part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third<br>parties under the terms of this License.<br><br>c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively<br>when run, you must cause it, when started running for such<br>interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an<br>announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a<br>notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide<br>a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under<br>these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this<br>License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but<br>does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on<br>the Program is not required to print an announcement.)<br><br>These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If<br>identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,<br>and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in<br>themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those<br>sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you<br>distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based<br>on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of<br>this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the<br>entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.<br><br>Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest<br>your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to<br>exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or<br>collective works based on the Program.<br><br>In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program<br>with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of<br>a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under<br>the scope of this License.<br><br>  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,<br>under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of<br>Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:<br><br>a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable<br>source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections<br>1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,<br><br>b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three<br>years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your<br>cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete<br>machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be<br>distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium<br>customarily used for software interchange; or,<br><br>c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer<br>to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is<br>allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you<br>received the program in object code or executable form with such<br>an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)<br><br>The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for<br>making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source<br>code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any<br>associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to<br>control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a<br>special exception, the source code distributed need not include<br>anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary<br>form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the<br>operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component<br>itself accompanies the executable.<br><br>If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering<br>access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent<br>access to copy the source code from the same place counts as<br>distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not<br>compelled to copy the source along with the object code.<br><br>  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program<br>except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt<br>otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is<br>void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.<br>However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under<br>this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such<br>parties remain in full compliance.<br><br>  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not<br>signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or<br>distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are<br>prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by<br>modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the<br>Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and<br>all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying<br>the Program or works based on it.<br><br>  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the<br>Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the<br>original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to<br>these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further<br>restrictions on the recipients'' exercise of the rights granted herein.<br>You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to<br>this License.<br><br>  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent<br>infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),<br>conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or<br>otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not<br>excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot<br>distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this<br>License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you<br>may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent<br>license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by<br>all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then<br>the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to<br>refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.<br><br>If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under<br>any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to<br>apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other<br>circumstances.<br><br>It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any<br>patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any<br>such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the<br>integrity of the free software distribution system, which is<br>implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made<br>generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed<br>through that system in reliance on consistent application of that<br>system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing<br>to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot<br>impose that choice.<br><br>This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to<br>be a consequence of the rest of this License.<br><br>  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in<br>certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the<br>original copyright holder who places the Program under this License<br>may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding<br>those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among<br>countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates<br>the limitation as if written in the body of this License.<br><br>  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions<br>of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will<br>be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to<br>address new problems or concerns.<br><br>Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program<br>specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any<br>later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions<br>either of that version or of any later version published by the Free<br>Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of<br>this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software<br>Foundation.<br><br>  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free<br>programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author<br>to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free<br>Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes<br>make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals<br>of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and<br>of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.<br><br>NO WARRANTY<br><br>  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY<br>FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN<br>OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES<br>PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED<br>OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF<br>MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS<br>TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE<br>PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,<br>REPAIR OR CORRECTION.<br><br>  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING<br>WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR<br>REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,<br>INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING<br>OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED<br>TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY<br>YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER<br>PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE<br>POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.<br><br>		 END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br><br>	How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs<br><br>  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest<br>possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it<br>free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.<br><br>  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest<br>to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively<br>convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least<br>the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.<br><br>&lt;one line to give the program''s name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;<br>Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt; &lt;name of author&gt;<br><br>This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify<br>it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by<br>the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or<br>(at your option) any later version.<br><br>This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,<br>but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of<br>MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the<br>GNU General Public License for more details.<br><br>You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along<br>with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc.,<br>51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA.<br><br>Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.<br><br>If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this<br>when it starts in an interactive mode:<br><br>Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author<br>Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w''.<br>This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it<br>under certain conditions; type `show c'' for details.<br><br>The hypothetical commands `show w'' and `show c'' should show the appropriate<br>parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may<br>be called something other than `show w'' and `show c''; they could even be<br>mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.<br><br>You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your<br>school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if<br>necessary.

If your program is a subroutine library, you may<br>consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the<br>library.
