# StringDialog.properties
#
# A default localization file for the Ganymede server
#
# Note: All single quotes must be doubled for escaping.. so "can't" becomes "can''t".

#
# Note.. this file is intended to contain the default localization for
# the Ok and Cancel strings in the Ganymede client.  By providing
# localization Strings for Ok and Cancel against
# StringDialog.properties, the StringDialog getDefaultOk() and
# getDefaultCancel() methods can provide these strings to lots of
# classes in the Ganymede client.

#global.ok = Ok
global.ok = Ok
#global.cancel = Cancel
global.cancel = Abbruch
