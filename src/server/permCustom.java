   *
   * This method provides a hook that can be used to indicate whether
   * a field that is defined in this object's field dictionary
   * should be newly instantiated in this particular object.
   *
   * This method does not affect those fields which are actually present
   * in the object's record in the DBStore.  What this method allows
   * you to do is have a subclass decide whether it wants to instantiate
   * a potential field (one that is declared in the field dictionary for
   * this object, but which doesn't happen to be presently defined in
   * this object) in this particular object.
   *
   * A concrete example will help here.  The Permissions Object type
   * (base number SchemaConstants.PermBase) holds a permission
   * matrix, a descriptive title, and a list of admin personae that hold
   * those permissions for objects they own.
   *
   * There are a few specific instances of SchemaConstants.PermBase
   * that don't properly need the list of admin personae, as their
   * object invids are hard-coded into the Ganymede security system, and
   * their permission matrices are automatically consulted in certain
   * situations.  In order to support this, we're going to want to have
   * a DBEditObject subclass for managing permission objects.  In that
   * subclass, we'll define instantiateNewField() so that it will return
   * false if the fieldID corresponds to the admin personae list if the
   * object's ID is that of one of these special objects.  As a result,
   * when the objects are viewed by an administrator, the admin personae
   * list will not be seen.
