Ganymede Release 2.0
8 January 2014
src/README

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Contained hereunder:

  The build/ directory contains the class and jar files produced by
  building Ganymede.

  The build.xml file is the master Ant build file for Ganymede.

  The ganymede/ directory contains all of the source code for the
  Ganymede server, client, and admin console.

  The jython/ directory contains Jython jar files used to provide
  interpreted Python support in the Ganymede server.  Not really used
  for much by us, but if you add 'telnet=<portnum>' to the Ganymede
  runServer script, Ganymede will support an interactive Python shell
  via telnet.

  The lib/ directory contains third party open source jar files that
  are used by the Ganymede software.

  The resources/ directory contains localization and image resources
  for the Ganymede server, client, and admin console.

  The schemas/ directory contains the customization logic that we use
  here at ARL:UT for our specific installation of Ganymede.
  
  The verification/ directory contains Perl scripts used by the
  'validate' task in the src/build.xml Ant file.  By running 'ant
  validate' in this directory, all Ganymede source code will be
  examined and compared with localization resources under resources/
  to produce a report as to the correctness and completeness of
  localization support for all languages present under resources/.
