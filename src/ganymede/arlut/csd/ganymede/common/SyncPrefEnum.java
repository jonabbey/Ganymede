 * object's Sync Data {@link arlut.csd.ganymede.server.FieldOptionDBField
 * FieldOptionDBField} field, and control whether a given object or
 * field should be written to that Sync Channel.</p>
 *
 * <p>Note that a Sync Channel may have an associated {@link
 * arlut.csd.ganymede.server.SyncMaster SyncMaster} class registered,
 * which can expand on the set of objects and fields written to a Sync
 * Channel.  The Sync Master class is free to add objects and fields
 * to the XML transaction file to provide context, and could be used
 * if the three-way logic implemented by SyncPrefEnum and the {@link
 * arlut.csd.ganymede.server.SyncRunner} class is not sufficient for
 * your needs.</p>
 *
 * <p>As a Java 5 enum, this class is inherently serializable, and the
 * Ganymede server's RMI API involves the transmission of SyncPrefEnum
 * values to and from Ganymede clients.</p>
