   QueryNode.java

   The QueryNode class is used to represent a node in a query tree.
   Each node can be an and node, an or node, a not node, or a leaf
   node.  Leaf nodes actually represent a comparator test.

   The QueryNode classes are serializable, for bodily transmission
   over an RMI connection.
