/**
 * <p>This class is designed to be subclassed in order to handle
 * full-state synchronization from the Ganymede server to external
 * directory service targets.</p>
 *
 * <p>GanymedeBuilderTask is really only intended to support directory
 * service targets that are 'dump and replace' in nature, like NIS and
 * classical DNS.  The reason for this is that GanymedeBuilderTasks
 * are executed asynchronously with respect to transaction commits.
 * By the time a GanymedeBuilderTask subclass runs, the Ganymede
 * server has forgotten all previous states of the data in the server.
 * All the GanymedeBuilderTask can do is check to see what kinds of
 * objects (Users, Groups, Systems, etc.) have changed since the last
 * time it was run.  It can also check to see which fields have been
 * changed, within those object types.  It cannot check to see whether
 * a particular field in a specific object has changed, however.
 * Since there's no way for a GanymedeBuilderTask to do a
 * before-and-after comparison, all it can reliably do is to write out
 * absolutely everything relevant to its synchronization channel, and
 * then hand off the build to an external process.  If you want to do
 * a more granular, before-and-after incremental build, you can
 * instead choose to use the more synchronous {@link
 * arlut.csd.ganymede.server.SyncRunner} class, which uses a standard
 * XML format to represent changes to external synchronization
 * processes.</p>
 *
 * <p>Subclasses of GanymedeBuilderTask need to implement the {@link
 * arlut.csd.ganymede.server.GanymedeBuilderTask#builderPhase1()} and
 * {@link
 * arlut.csd.ganymede.server.GanymedeBuilderTask#builderPhase2()}
 * methods.  builderPhase1() is run while a {@link
 * arlut.csd.ganymede.server.DBDumpLock} is asserted on the server's
 * {@link arlut.csd.ganymede.server.DBStore DBStore}, guaranteeing a
 * transaction-consistent database state that can be examined.
 * builderPhase1() should do whatever is required to examine the
 * database and to determine whether this builder task needs to carry
 * out a build.  If so, builderPhase1() should write out the data
 * files that will be needed for builderPhase2() and return true.
 * When builderPhase1() completes, the dump lock is released.  If
 * builderPhase1() returns true, the builderPhase2() method is then
 * run.  This method is intended to run external scripts (typically
 * written in Perl or Python) that process the files written out by
 * the builderPhase1() method.</p>
 *
 * <p>All subclasses of GanymedeBuilderTask need to be registered in
 * the Ganymede database via the Task object type.
 * GanymedeBuilderTasks registered to be run on database commit will
 * automatically be issued by the {@link
 * arlut.csd.ganymede.server.GanymedeScheduler GanymedeScheduler} when
 * transactions commit.  The GanymedeScheduler is designed to run only
 * a single instance of a task at a time, waiting to issue any new
 * execution of the task until the previous execution completes.  A
 * GanymedeBuilderTask doesn't finish executing until its
 * builderPhase2() method returns.  This protects your builderPhase2()
 * method from having its input data being overwritten by the next
 * builderPhase1() method writing out new data.  It also sets a
 * minimum build-to-build latency, according to how long your
 * builderPhase1() and builderPhase2() methods take to complete.  No
 * matter how long builderPhase2() takes, the GanymedeScheduler will
 * run the builds as fast as it can, back-to-back.</p>
 *
 * <p>Your builderPhase1() method, however, should execute and
 * complete as fast as possible.  The dump lock protecting
 * builderPhase1() prevents any transactions from committing while a
 * builderPhase1() method is executing.  Any significant delay in
 * transaction commits may cause noticeable delays for your users.
 * Fortunately, since builderPhase1() implementations just scan the
 * Ganymede in-memory database and write out some text files, this
 * usually doesn't take very long.  If you find that your
 * builderPhase1() method is taking too long, you may want to consider
 * splitting your build into multiple builder tasks.  The
 * GanymedeBuilderTask is designed so that the server can execute
 * multiple distinct builder tasks concurrently.  Splitting your build
 * into multiple pieces that can be run concurrently can also improve
 * your build latency by reducing the amount of work that a given
 * external process has to do when called by builderPhase2().</p>
 *
 * <p>GanymedeBuilderTask includes a set of helper methods that
 * subclasses can take advantage of in order to facilitate their
 * operation.</p>
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>The {@link
 * arlut.csd.ganymede.server.GanymedeBuilderTask#baseChanged(short)}
 * method can be used from {@link
 * arlut.csd.ganymede.server.GanymedeBuilderTask#builderPhase1()} to
 * check to see whether objects of a given type have been changed
 * since the builder task was last run.</li>
 *
 * <li>The {@link
 * arlut.csd.ganymede.server.GanymedeBuilderTask#getOptionValue(java.lang.String)}
 * method makes it possible for a builder task to retrieve
 * configuration information from the task object in the Ganymede
 * database which links the task into the server's scheduling.</li>
 *
 * <li>The {@link
 * arlut.csd.ganymede.server.GanymedeBuilderTask#openOutFile(java.lang.String,
 * java.lang.String)} method not only opens files for writing, it also
 * takes care to manage the archiving of old versions of the emitted
 * file.  The <code>ganymede.builder.backups</code> property controls
 * this behavior.  It should be set to a path for keeping zipped
 * copies of previous builder outputs if you want this archiving
 * feature to be in effect.  If it is, whenever files are opened by a
 * builder task using openOutFile(), previous copies of those files
 * will be moved to the directory set in
 * <code>ganymede.builder.backups</code>.  The first time after
 * midnight that openOutFile() is called by a builder task, all of the
 * files written out the previous day by the builder task will be
 * collected into a single zip file.  This can be handy, but you may
 * not actually want to have certain files archived.  In that case,
 * you should have your external sync script take care to remove such
 * files after processing them..</li>
 *
 * <li>The {@link
 * arlut.csd.ganymede.server.GanymedeBuilderTask#enumerateObjects(short)}
 * method can be used by builderPhase1() to get an Enumeration of
 * objects of a given type to examine for writing.</li>
 *</ul>
 *
 * <p>In addition, the GanymedeBuilderTask base class logic is
 * responsible for interfacing with the rest of the Ganymede server to
 * display each builder task's status, both in the admin console and
 * in the client.  The little conveyor belt icon in the lower left
 * corner of the Ganymede graphical client is controlled by the action
 * of the GanymedeBuilderTask and SyncRunner objects being run after a
 * transaction commit.</p>

   * build process by running (probably external) code that does not
   * require direct access to the database.</p>
   *
   * <p>For instance, for an NIS builder task, builderPhase1() would scan
   * the Ganymede object store and write out NIS-compatible source
   * files.  builderPhase1() would return, the run() method drops the
   * dump lock so that other transactions can be committed, and then
   * builderPhase2() can be run to turn those on-disk files written by
   * builderPhase1() into NIS maps.  This generally involves executing
   * an external Makefile, which can take an indeterminate period of
   * time.</p>
   *
   * <p>It is important that any external process run by
   * builderPhase2() blocks until it is finished doing the build.  If
   * the external script tries to put itself into the background and
   * return early, the Ganymede server will conclude that the external
   * build has completely finished, and it will feel free to
   * immediately schedule this builder task again, which may mean that
   * the builderPhase1() method will overwrite files the backgrounded
   * external builder process is still using.</p>
   *
   * <p>Note as well that the Ganymede server makes no guarantee as to
   * what the environment variables or current working directory will
   * be set to when any external builder scripts are executed.  If
   * your external scripts depend on these things, you should make
   * sure that your external builder script sets them itself.</p>
   *
   * <p>By releasing the dumpLock before we get to that point, we
   * minimize contention for users of the system.</p>
   *
   * <p>As a result of having dropped the dumpLock, enumerateObjects()
   * cannot be called by this method.</p>
   *
   * <p>builderPhase2() can throw a ServiceNotFoundException or
   * ServiceFailedException to indicate to the admin console that the
   * build failed, or it can simply return a boolean result to
