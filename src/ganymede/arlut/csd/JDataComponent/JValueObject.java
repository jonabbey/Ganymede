   JValueObject.java

   Base class for a new hierarchy of classes used to pass
   callback data in the arlut.csd.JDataComponent package.

   Formerly, this class was an all-in-one class that tried to encode a
   bunch of different operations, with a mess of different
   constructors and interpretations of parameters.

   Now this class will serve as a base class, and all of the actual
   data transport will be done by operation-specific subclasses.
