/**
 * <p>Utility class to provide localized string assembly services.
 * This class is designed to use localized properties files to do
 * string lookup and synthesis.</p>
 *
 * <p>The Ganymede source tree uses TranslationService pervasively to
 * handle translation for all text message strings in the server,
 * client, and admin console.</p>
 *
 * <p>This class must be used in conjunction with a particular usage
 * convention in order to support automatic validation of message
 * files with the 'ant validate' task in the Ganymede build.xml file.</p>
 *
 * <p>That convention is that every class that needs language
 * translation services must declare a static final TranslationService
 * object named 'ts' which is initialized with the fully qualified
 * name of the class to which it belongs.</p>
 *
 * <p>Actual translation calls should all be in the form of
 * ts.l("messageName"), possibly with extra parameters, such as
 * ts.l("messageName", arg1, arg2), and so forth.  The 'l' method of
 * TranslationService is designed to be as compact as possible so that
 * it can be used wherever you would normally use a string.  It
 * returns a String formatted according to whatever language-sensitive
 * property files are defined in Ganymede's src/resources
 * directory.</p>
 *
 * <p>If you follow these conventions, the 'ant validate' task will be
 * able to automatically analyze your code and cross reference it
 * against the message property files under src/resources.  'ant
 * validate' will warn you if you are missing messages, or if the
 * messages are malformed, or if the messages specify a different
 * number of parameters than the source code which users the messages
 * is expecting.</p>
 *
 * <p>So, for use within Ganymede, please be sure always to follow
 * these conventions.</p>
