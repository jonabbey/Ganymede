Ganymede Release 2.0
22 January 2013
README.localization

---------------------------------------------

Ganymede 2.0 includes extensive support for localization and
internationalization.  The Ganymede server, client, admin console and
text mode xmlclient all use property files to define all publicly
visible message strings.

These properties files are located under src/resources.  The bulk of
the Ganymede server's message files are located under

    src/resources/arlut/csd/ganymede/server

and those for the client are located under

    src/resources/arlut/csd/ganymede/client

and for the admin console under

    src/resources/arlut/csd/ganymede/admin

The Ganymede 2.0 distribution currently includes the default English
language message files and a quite complete German language
translation, provided by Stefan Bier from fg-networking.de.

When you run the Ganymede server, client, or admin console, you will
by default see the language suitable for the system you are running
the server, client, or admin console on.  Dates and numbers will also
be printed with a region and language-suitable form.

If you want, you can force the use of a specific language.  See the
runServer script for instructions on how to set the language for the
server, and the client.jnlp and console.jnlp files for instructions on
how to force a specific language for the client and admin console.

If you like, you can create your own translation files for Ganymede by
creating new properties files in the above directories.

The default message files are named after the classes they are
serving.  For instance, the message strings for the client's central
class, arlut.csd.ganymede.client.gclient, is held in
src/resources/arlut/csd/ganymede/client/gclient.properties.

German language message strings are held in files named after the
class are named the same, with the ISO language code addded to the
name of the class.  The German version of the gclient message file is
called src/resources/arlut/csd/ganymede/client/gclient_de.properties.

By extension, a French language message file would be
gclient_fr.properties, a Norwegian version would be
gclient_no.properties, etc.

You can find a complete list of these language codes at
http://ftp.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/http/related/iso639.txt

To support adopters writing their own translations, Ganymede's ant
build script, src/build.xml, includes special support for validating
all message files against the Ganymede source code.

If you run 'ant validate', a Perl script will be run which will
analyze all message files and cross-check them against the Ganymede
sources.  'ant validate' will print out a report letting you know how
complete your translation is, and whether it is properly constructed.

If you do generate a new translation for Ganymede, we encourage you to
send us patches at ganymede_author@arlut.utexas.edu for us to
incorporate into the master Ganymede repository.

You could also fork Ganymede on GitHub and submit pull requests to
'jonabbey'.

Thanks!
